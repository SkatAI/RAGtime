The context they are used in is decisive for how much and what kind of influence they can have, and whether they are perceived by an observer as “intelligent”. The term “automated decision-making” (ADM) has been proposed as it could avoid the possible ambiguity of the term AI. ADM involves a user delegating initially a decision, partly or completely, to an entity by way of using a system or a service. That entity then uses automatically executed decision-making models to perform an action on behalf of a user, or to inform the user’s decisions in performing an action",

As noted by the group, Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for people, societies and companies to develop, deploy and use AI systems. Without AI systems – and the human beings behind them – being demonstrably worthy of trust, serious and unwanted consequences may ensue and the uptake of AI might be hindered, preventing the realisation of the potentially vast social and economic benefits that trustworthy AI systems can bring.

In the drafting process of these delegated acts, the Commission shall insure the input of all relevant stakeholders including the technical experts and developers of AI systems. This consultation can take place through existing bodies such as the High Level Expert Group on AI or a newly established similar advisory body that is closely included in the work of the European Artificial Intelligence Board. Should the definition of ‘AI system’ from the OECD be adjusted in the coming years, the European Commission should engage in dialogue with these organisations to ensure alignment between the two definitions. Should the AI Act still be undergoing legislative procedure, the co-legislators should consider these latest developments during the legislative process, so as to ensure alignment, legal clarity and broad international acceptance of the AI Act Definition of ‘AI Systems’.",

Experts speak of an automated system with different levels of automation instead of levels of autonomy. Autonomy is understood as the highest level of automation. An autonomous AI system would be capable to change its scope or its goals independently. However, today's AI technologies do not allow full autonomy yet and are not self-governing. Instead, they operate based on algorithms and otherwise obey the commands of operators. A fully autonomous AI system would be a genuine General or Super AI.

Because RBI relates to how a system is designed and installed, and not solely to whether or not data subjects have consented, this definition applies even when warning notices are placed in the location that is under the surveillance of the RBI system, and is not de facto annulled by pre-enrolment.",

The reliability of face recognition technologies in 'real world' settings is highly dependent on the quality of the images captured and on the quality of the algorithms used for biometric matching. During enrolment, poor quality images taken at e-gates or through a CCTV camera under variable environmental conditions may result in less accurate results.

These include systems that influence individual’s health outcomes but do not meet the criteria for a medical device, systems that influence population health outcomes or health equality, systems that impact the distribution of healthcare resources and systems used by pharmaceutical and medical technology companies in research and development, pharmacovigilance, market optimisation and pharmaceutical marketing. Bias and errors in health-related AI systems can have major and immediate consequences for individuals’ and populations’ health and wellbeing. Further, many systems will use sensitive and personal data, which needs to be justified, and about which patients need to be properly informed. What is more, systems that work on hospital, health system, or population level may have a major effect on societal health because they influence the distribution of healthcare resources and health policy design.

In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, the user of high-risk AI systems should therefore carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment on how it intends to use such AI systems, and prior to putting it into use. The impact assessment should be accompanied by a detailed plan describing the measures or tools that will help mitigating the risks to fundamental rights identified. When performing this impact assessment, the user should notify the national supervisory authority, the market surveillance authority as well as relevant stakeholders.

When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following:', '(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as, where appropriate, the number of affected persons and the level of harm suffered by them;', '(b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;', '(c) any action taken by the operator to mitigate the harm suffered by the users or the affected persons;', '(d) the degree of responsibility of the operator taking into account the technical and organisational measures implemented by them;', '(e) any relevant previous infringements by the operator;', '(f) the degree of cooperation with the national supervisory authority, in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement, including compliance with any of the measures previously ordered by the national supervisory authority with regard to the same subject matter', '(g) the manner in which the infringement became known to the national supervisory authority, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the operator notified the infringement;', '(h) adherence to approved codes of conduct or approved certification mechanisms; and', '(i) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement.', '3. If an operator, intentionally or negligently, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.', '4. The non-compliance of the AI system with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence practices referred to in Article 5 shall be subject to administrative fines of up to 50 000 000 or, if the offender is a company, up to 10% of its total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.', '5. The non-compliance of the AI system with the requirements laid down in Article10 shall be subject to administrative fines of up to 40 000 000 EUR or, if the offender is company, up to 8 % of its total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.', '6. The non-compliance of the AI system with any requirements or obligations under this Regulation, other than those laid down in Articles 5 and 10, shall be subject to administrative fines of up to 30 000 000 EUR or, if the offender is a company, up to 6 % of its total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.', '7.

Without prejudice to the corrective powers of national supervisory authorities, each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in that Member State.', '9. The exercise by the national supervisory authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process.', '10. Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the national supervisory authority and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by national supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by [3 months after entry into force] and, without delay, any subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting them.",
