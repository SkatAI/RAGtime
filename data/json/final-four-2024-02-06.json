[COD 2021\/414\/EC]] On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such laws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the laws on the protection of minors (i.e. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legimitate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation. (5aa) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by Regulations (EU) 2016\/679 and (EU) 2018\/1725 and Directive 2016\/680. Directive 2002\/58\/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by way of providing conditions for any personal and non-personal data storing in and access from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with those instruments. It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their role as data controllers or processors stemming from national or Union law on the protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights. (5ab) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000\/31\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act].",

        "draft":"(14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm . Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.",

Emotions or expressions of emotions and perceptions thereof vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such technologies, are the limited reliability (emotion categories are neither reliably expressed through, nor unequivocally associated with, a common set of physical or physiological movements), the lack of specificity (physical or physiological expressions do not perfectly match emotion categories) and the limited generalisability (the effects of context and culture are not sufficiently considered). Reliability issues and consequently, major risks for abuse, may especially arise when deploying the system in real-life situations related to law enforcement, border management, workplace and education institutions. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used in these contexts to detect the emotional state of individuals should be prohibited.",

Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited.

Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017\/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006\/42\/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way.

Therefore only when such output has a high degree of importance (i.e. is not purely accessory) in respect of the relevant action or decision so as to generate a significant risk to the legal interests protected, the AI system generating such output should be considered as high-risk. For instance, when the information provided by an AI systems to the human consists of the profiling of natural persons within the meaning of of Article 4(4) Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation (EU) 2018\/1725, such information should not typically be considered of accessory nature in the context of high risk AI systems as referred to in Annex III.

This could take the form of a one-page summary of the relevant information on the AI system in question, including its intended purpose and why it would not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment. The Commission should specify criteria to enable companies to assess whether their system would pose such risks, as well as develop an easy to use and standardised template for the notification. Providers should submit the notification as early as possible and in any case prior to the placing of the AI system on the market or its putting into service, ideally at the development stage, and they should be free to place it on the market at any given time after the notification. However, if the authority estimates the AI system in question was misclassified, it should object to the notification within a period of three months. The objection should be substantiated and duly explain why the AI system has been misclassified. The provider should retain the right to appeal by providing further arguments. If after the three months there has been no objection to the notification, national supervisory authorities could still intervene if the AI system presents a risk at national level, as for any other AI system on the market. National supervisory authorities should submit annual reports to the AI Office detailing the notifications received and the decisions taken.",

For the purpose of this Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in Annex III should be considered to pose signficant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018\/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases of AI systems.",

The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.",

In identifying reasonably foreseeable misuse of high risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider.

        "draft":"(51a) Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, high-risk AI systems which fall within the scope of the Regulation 2022\/0272, in accordance with Article 8 of the the Regulation 2022\/0272 may demonstrate compliance with the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex I of the Regulation 2022\/0272.When high-risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of Regulation 2022\/0272, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out in this Regulation in so far as the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof issued under Regulation 2022\/0272. For this purpose, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital elements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under Regulation 2022\/0272, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation. The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022\/0272 and classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation. However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical products with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022\/0272. Therefore, by way of derogation from this rule, high-risk AI systems that fall within the scope of this Regulation and are also qualified as important and critical products with digital elements pursuant to Regulation 2022\/0272 and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI of this Regulation applies, are subject to the conformity assessment provisions of Regulation 2022\/0272 insofar as the essential cybersecurity requirements of Regulation 2022\/0272 are concerned. In this case, for all the other aspects covered by this Regulation the respective provisions on conformity assessment based on internal control set out in Annex VI of this Regulation should apply. Building on the knowledge and expertise of ENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to ENISA under the Regulation 2019\/1020 the European Commission should cooperate with ENISA on issues related to cybersecurity of AI systems.",

Services important for individuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in case of the materialisation of these risk.The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the fundamental rights of these persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including for example governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and designing measures to be taken in the case of materialization of the risks. The AI Office should develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.",

The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is placed on the market.",

        "draft":"(60n) It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general purpose AI model as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.",

A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is especially important with regard to general purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.",

The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system.

Due to the specific nature of Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to designate the European Data Protection Supervisor as a competent market surveillance authority for them. This should be without prejudice to the designation of national competent authorities by the Member States. Market surveillance activities, should Rot affect the ability of the supervised entities to carry out their tasks independently, when such independence is required by Union law.",

(80-x) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III insofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III should have effective investigative and corrective powers, including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance authorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence. Any limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016\/680. No exclusion on disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should affect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation. (80x) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be able to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market surveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States. Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the 2019\/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations. (80y) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level as regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping competences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model and system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 for this purpose. In all other cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI systems. However, for general purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high risk, market surveillance authorities should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general purpose AI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding mutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 should apply by analogy. (80z) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the powers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards general purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI systems. (80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general purpose AI models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the information necessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from a provider. (80z+2) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by requesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures, including risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting the making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in case needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of general-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation.",

Codes of Practice should be ready at the latest 3 months before the entry into application of the relevant provisions, to enable providers to demonstrate compliance in time. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological developments.

A contractual term concerning the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high risk AI system or the remedies for the breach or the termination of related obligations which has been unilaterally imposed by an enterprise on a SME or startup shall not be binding on the latter enterprise if it is unfair. 2. A contractual term is not to be considered unfair where it arises from applicable Union law. 3. A contractual term is unfair if it is of such a nature that it objectively impairs the ability of the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed to protect its legitimate commercial interest in the information in question or its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system, contrary to good faith and fair dealing or creates a significant imbalance between the rights and the obligations of the parties in the contract. A contractual term is also unfair if it has the effect of shifting penalties referred to in Article 71 or associated litigation costs across parties to the contract, as referred to in Article 71(8). 4. A contractual term is unfair for the purposes of this Article if its object or effect is to: (a) exclude or limit the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term for intentional acts or gross negligence; (b) exclude the remedies available to the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed in the case of non-performance of contractual obligations or the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term in the case of a breach of those obligations; (c) give the party that unilaterally imposed the term the exclusive right to determine whether the technical documentation, information supplied are in conformity with the contract or to interpret any term of the contract. 5. A contractual term shall be considered to be unilaterally imposed within the meaning of this Article if it has been supplied by one contracting party and the other contracting party has not been able to influence its content despite an attempt to negotiate it. The contracting party that supplied a contractual term shall bears the burden of proving that that term has not been unilaterally imposed. 6. Where the unfair contractual term is severable from the remaining terms of the contract, those remaining terms shall remain binding. The party that supplied the contested term shall not argue that the term is an unfair term. 7. This Article shall apply to all new contracts entered into force after ... [date of entry into force of this Regulation]. Businesses shall review existing contractual obligations that are subject to this Regulation by …[three years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation]. 8.

For the purpose of paragraph 1, the provider of a foundation model shall: (a) demonstrate through appropriate design, testing and analysis the identification, the reduction and mitigation of reasonably foreseeable risks to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment and democracy and the rule of law prior and throughout development with appropriate methods such as with the involvement of independent experts, as well as the documentation of remaining non mitigable risks after development (b) process and incorporate only datasets that are subject to appropriate data governance measures for foundation models, in particular measures to examine the suitability of the data sources and possible biases and appropriate mitigation (c) design and develop the foundation model in order to achieve throughout its lifecycle appropriate levels of performance, predictability, interpretability, corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity assessed through appropriate methods such as model evaluation with the involvement of independent experts, documented analysis, and extensive testing during conceptualisation, design, and development; (d) design and develop the foundation model, making use of applicable standards to reduce energy use, resource use and waste, as well as to increase energy efficiency, and the overall efficiency of the system, whithout prejudice to relevant existing Union and national law. This obligation shall not apply before the standards referred to in Article 40 are published. Foundation models shall be designed with capabilities enabling the measurement and logging of the consumption of energy and resources, and, where technically feasible, other environmental impact the deployment and use of the systems may have over their entire lifecycle; (e) draw up extensive technical documentation and intelligible instructions for use, in order to enable the downstream providers to comply with their obligations pursuant to Articles 16 and 28(1);. (f) establish a quality management system to ensure and document compliance with this Article, with the possibility to experiment in fulfilling this requirement, (g) register that foundation model in the EU database referred to in Article 60, in accordance with the instructions outlined in Annex VIII point C. When fulfilling those requirements, the generally acknowledged state of the art shall be taken into account, including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or common specifications, as well as the latest assessment and measurement methods, reflected in particular in benchmarking guidance and capabilities referred to in Article 58a; 3. Providers of foundation models shall, for a period ending 10 years after their foundation models have been placed on the market or put into service, keep the technical documentation referred to in paragraph 2(e) at the disposal of the national competent authorities 4. Providers of foundation models used in AI systems specifically intended to generate, with varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex text, images, audio, or video (“generative AI”) and providers who specialise a foundation model into a generative AI system, shall in addition a) comply with the transparency obligations outlined in Article 52 (1), b) train, and where applicable, design and develop the foundation model in such a way as to ensure adequate safeguards against the generation of content in breach of Union law in line with the generally-acknowledged state of the art, and without prejudice to fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, c) without prejudice to Union or national or Union legislation on copyright, document and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary of the use of training data protected under copyright law.",

Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016\/680, in the framework of an investigation for the targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a criminal offence, the deployer of an AI system for post-remote biometric identification shall request an authorisation, prior, or without undue delay and no later than 48hours, by a judicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to judicial review, for the use of the system, except when the system is used for the initial identification of a potential suspect based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to the offence. Each use shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the investigation of a specific criminal offence. If the requested authorisation provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is rejected, the use of the post remote biometric identification system linked to that authorisation shall be stopped with immediate effect and the personal data linked to the use of the system for which the authorisation was requested shall be deleted. In any case, such AI system for post remote biometric identification shall not be used for law enforcement purposes in an untargeted way, without any link to a criminal offence, a criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal offence or the search for a specific missing person. It shall be ensured that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken by the law enforcement authorities solely based on the output of these post remote biometric identification systems. This paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10 of the Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 9 of the GDPR for the processing of biometric data. Regardless of the purpose or deployer, each use of these systems shall be documented in the relevant police file and shall be made available to the relevant market surveillance authority and the national data protection authority upon request, excluding the disclosure of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. This subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the powers conferred by the Directive 2016\/680 to supervisory authorities. Deployers shall, in addition, submit annual reports to the relevant market surveillance and national data protection authorities on the uses of post-remote biometric identification systems, excluding the disclosure of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. The reports can be aggregated to cover several deployments in one operation. Member States may introduce, in accordance with Union law, more restrictive laws on the use of post remote biometric identification systems.",

This assessment shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: (a) a clear outline of the intended purpose for which the system will be used; (b) a clear outline of the intended geographic and temporal scope of the system’s use; (c) categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by the use of the system; (d) verification that the use of the system is compliant with relevant Union and national law on fundamental rights; (e) the reasonably foreseeable impact on fundamental rights of putting the high-risk AI system into use; (f) specific risks of harm likely to impact marginalised persons or vulnerable groups; (g) the reasonably foreseeable adverse impact of the use of the system on the environment; (h) a detailed plan as to how the harms and the negative impact on fundamental rights identified will be mitigated. (j) the governance system the deployer will put in place, including human oversight, complaint handling and redress. 2. If a detailed plan to mitigate the risks outlined in the course of the assessment outlined in paragraph 1 cannot be identified, the deployer shall refrain from putting the high-risk AI system into use and inform the provider and the National supervisory authority without undue delay. National supervisory authorities, pursuant to Articles 65 and 67, shall take this information into account when investigating systems which present a risk at national level. 3. The obligation outlined under paragraph 1 applies for the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, draw back on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessment or existing assessment carried out by providers. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that the criteria listed in paragraph 1 are not longer met, it shall conduct a new fundamental rights impact assessment. 4. In the course of the impact assessment, the deployer, with the exception of SMEs, shall shall notify national supervisory authority and relevant stakeholders and shall, to best extent possible, involve representatives of the persons or groups of persons that are likely to be affected by the high risk AI system, as identified in paragraph 1, including but not limited to: equality bodies, consumer protection agencies, social partners and data protection agencies, with a view to receiving input into the impact assessment. The deployer shall allow a period of six weeks for bodies to respond. SMEs may voluntarily apply the provisions laid down in this paragraph. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), public authorities may be exempted from this obligations. 5. The deployer that is a public authority or an undertaking referred to in Article 51(1a) (b) shall publish a summary of the results of the impact assessment as part of the registration of use pursuant to their obligation under Article 51(2). 6. Where the deployer is already required to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016\/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with the data protection impact assessment. The data protection impact assessment shall be published as an addendum.",

Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system as defined in Article 6(2) into use, with the exception of AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are bodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services and operators deploying high-risk systems referred to in Annex III, point 5, b) and d) shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of the system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of: a) a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose; b) a description of the period of time and frequency in which each high-risk AI system is intended to be used c) the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context; d) the specific risks of harm likely to impact the categories of persons or group of persons identified pursuant point (c), taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to article 13; e) a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions of use; f) the measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including their arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms. 2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the factors listed in paragraph 1change are or no longer up to date, the deployer will take the necessary steps to update the information. 3. Once the impact assessment has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of the results of the assessment, submitting the filled template referred to in paragraph 5 as a part of the notification. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), deployers may be exempted from these obligations. 4. If any of the obligations laid down in this article are already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016\/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with that data protection impact assessment. 5.

        "draft":"Chapter I Supervision, investigation, enforcement and monitoring in respect of providers of general purpose AI Models Article A Enforcement of obligations on providers of general purpose AI models 1. The Commission shall have exclusive powers to supervise and enforce Chapter\/Title [general purpose AI models] taking into account the procedural guarantees by virtue of Article H. The Commission shall entrust the implementation of these tasks to the European AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between Member States and the Union based on the Treaties. 2. Without prejudice to Article 63a paragraph 3, market surveillance authorities may request to the Commission to exercise the powers laid down in this Chapter, where this is necessary and proportionate to assist with the fulfilment of their tasks under this Regulation. Article B Monitoring actions For the purposes of carrying out the tasks assigned to it under this Chapter, the AI Office may take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation and compliance with this Regulation by providers of general purpose AI models, including adherence to approved codes of practice. 2. Downstream providers shall have the right to lodge a complaint alleging an infringement of this Regulation. A complaint shall be duly reasoned and at least indicate: (a) the point of contact of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned; (b) description of the relevant facts, the provisions of this Regulation concerned and the reason why the downstream provider considers that the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned infringed this Regulation; (c) any other information that the downstream provider that sent the request considers relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative. Article C Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel 1. The scientific panel may provide a qualified alert to the AI Office where it has reason to suspect that (a) a general purpose AI model poses concrete identifiable risk at Union level; or (b) a general purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in Article [Classification of general purpose AI models with systemic risk…]. 2. Upon such qualified alert, the Commission, through the AI Office and after having informed the AI Board, may exercise the powers laid down in this Chapter for the purpose of assessing the matter. The AI Office shall inform the Board of any measure according to Articles [D-H]. 3. A qualified alert shall be duly reasoned and at least indicate: (a) the point of contact of the provider of the general purpose AI model with systemic risk concerned; (b) a description of the relevant facts and reasons for the suspicion of the scientific panel; (c) any other information that the scientific panel considers relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative. Article D Power to request documentation and information 1. The Commission may request the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned to provide the documentation drawn up by the provider according to Article [Obligations for providers of general purpose AI models] and [Obligations on providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risk] or any additional information that is necessary for the purpose of assessing compliance of the provider with this Regulation. 2. Before the request for information is sent, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model. 3. Upon a duly substantiated request from the scientific panel, the Commission may issue a request for information to a provider of a general purpose AI model, where the access to information is necessary and proportionate for the fulfilment of the tasks of the scientific panel according to Article [Scientific panel](2). 4. The request for information shall state the legal basis and the purpose of the request, specifying what information is required and set the period within which the information is to be provided, and the fines provided for in Article [fines] for supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information. 5. The provider of the general purpose AI model concerned or their representatives and, in the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where they have no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their constitution shall supply the information requested on behalf of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned. Lawyers duly authorised to act may supply the information on behalf of their clients. The latter shall remain fully responsible if the information supplied is incomplete, incorrect or misleading. Article E Power to conduct evaluations 1. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general purpose AI model concerned (a) to assess compliance of the provider with the obligations under this Regulation, where the information gathered pursuant to Article D [Power to request information] is insufficient; or (b) to investigate systemic risks at Union level of general purpose AI models with systemic risk, in particular following a qualified report from the scientific panel in accordance with point (c) of Article [Enforcement of obligations on providers of general purpose AI models and general purpose AI models with systemic risk](3) . 2. The Commission may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel pursuant to Article [scientific panel of independent experts]. All independent experts appointed for this task shall meet the criteria outlined in Article 58b, paragraph 2. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the Commission may request access to the general purpose AI model concerned through application programming interfaces (‘API’) or further appropriate technical means and tools, including through source code. 4. The request for access shall state the legal basis, the purpose and reasons of the request and set the period within which the access is to be provided, and the fines provided for in Article [fines] for failure to provide access. 5. The providers of the general purpose AI model concerned and, in the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where they have no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their constitution shall provide the access requested on behalf of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned. 6. The modalities and the conditions of the evaluations, including the modalities for involving independent experts and the procedure for the selection of the latter, shall be set out in implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article xx(x). 7. Prior to requesting access to the general purpose AI model concerned, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model to gather more information on the internal testing of the model, internal safeguards for preventing systemic risks, and other internal procedures and measures the provider has taken to mitigate such risks. Article F Power to request measures 1. Where necessary and appropriate, the Commission may request providers to (a) take appropriate measures to comply with the obligations set out in Title\/Chapter [Obligations for provider of general purpose AI models]; (b) require a provider to implement mitigation measures, where the evaluation carried out in accordance with Article [Power to conduct evaluations] has given rise to serious and substantiated concern of a systemic risk at Union level; (c) restrict the making available on the market, withdraw or recall the model. 2. Before a measure is requested, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model. 3. If, during the structured dialogue under paragraph 2, the provider of the general purpose AI model with systemic risk offers commitments to implement mitigation meausres to address a systemic risk at Union level, the Commission may by decision make these commitments binding and declare that there are no further grounds for action. Article H Procedural rights of economic operators of the general purpose AI model Article 18 of the Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 apply by analogy to the providers of the general purpose AI model without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for in this Regulation.",

The Commission may impose on providers of general purpose AI models fines not exceeding 3% of its total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year or 15 million EUR whichever is higher. Fines should be imposed one year after the entry into application of the relevant provisions in this Regulation in order to allow providers sufficient time to adapt when the Commission finds that the provider intentionally or negligently: (a) infringes the relevant provisions of this Regulation; (b) fails to comply with a request for document or information pursuant to Article [Power to request documentation and information], or supply of incorrect, incomplete or misleading information; (b) fails to comply with a measure requested under Article [Power to request measures]; (c) fails to make available to the Commission access to the general purpose AI model or general purpose AI model with systemic risk with a view to conduct an evaluation pursuant to Article [Power to conduct evaluations]. In fixing the amount of the fine or periodic penalty payment, regard shall be had to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking due account of the principles of proportionality and appropriateness. The Commission shall also into account commitments made in accordance with Article F(3) or in relevant codes of practice in accordance with Article [Codes of practice]. 2. Before adopting the decision pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall communicate its preliminary findings to the provider of the general purpose AI model or general purpose AI model with systemic risk and give opportunity to be heard. 2a. Fines imposed in accordance with this article shall be proportionate, dissuasive and effective. 2b. The information on the fines shall be also communicated to the Board as appropriate. 3. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have unlimited jurisdiction to review decisions whereby the Commission has fixed a fine. It may cancel, reduce or increase the fine imposed. 4. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the modalities and practical arrangements for the proceedings in view of possible adoptions of decisions pursuant to paragraph 1.
