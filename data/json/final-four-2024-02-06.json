It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights. (5ab) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000\/31\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act].",

This does not include biometric categorization systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can only be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.",

To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and users deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union.

        "draft":"(14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm . Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.",

Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. This prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.",

Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017\/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006\/42\/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way.

        "parliament":"(32a) Providers whose AI systems fall under one of the areas and use cases listed in Annex III that consider their system does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment should inform the national supervisory authorities by submitting a reasoned notification. This could take the form of a one-page summary of the relevant information on the AI system in question, including its intended purpose and why it would not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment. The Commission should specify criteria to enable companies to assess whether their system would pose such risks, as well as develop an easy to use and standardised template for the notification. Providers should submit the notification as early as possible and in any case prior to the placing of the AI system on the market or its putting into service, ideally at the development stage, and they should be free to place it on the market at any given time after the notification. However, if the authority estimates the AI system in question was misclassified, it should object to the notification within a period of three months. The objection should be substantiated and duly explain why the AI system has been misclassified. The provider should retain the right to appeal by providing further arguments. If after the three months there has been no objection to the notification, national supervisory authorities could still intervene if the AI system presents a risk at national level, as for any other AI system on the market. National supervisory authorities should submit annual reports to the AI Office detailing the notifications received and the decisions taken.",
        "draft":"(32a) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred to pre defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the decision making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in Annex III should be considered to pose signficant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018\/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases of AI systems.",

In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented.

The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.",

The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk management measures in the light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying reasonably foreseeable misuse of high risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider. This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training measures for the high-risk AI system by the provider to address them.

The monitoring and reporting of the emissions of AI systems must be robust, transparent, consistent and accurate. In order to ensure the uniform application of this Regulation and stable legal ecosystem for providers and deployers in the Single Market, the Commission should develop a common specification for the methodology to fulfil the reporting and documentation requirement on the consumption of energy and resources during development, training and deployment.

Private operators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in case of the materialisation of these risk.The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the fundamental rights of these persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use.

The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities.

Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general purpose AI model as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.",

The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on.

The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.",

As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only be transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Data Act.",

In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on eployers of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013\/36\/EU.",
        "draft":"(80) Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk management rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course of provision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems. In order to ensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legislation, the ompetent authorities for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services legislation, otably competent authorities as defined in Directive 2009\/138\/EC, Directive (EU) 2016\/97, Directive 2013\/36\/EU Regulation (EU) No 575\/2013, Directive 2008\/48\/EC and Directive 2014\/17\/EU of the European arliament and of the Council, should be designated, within their respective competences, as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions unless Member States decide to designate another authority to fulfil these market surveillance tasks. Those competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 on market surveillance to enforce the requirements and obligations of this Regulation, including powers to carry our ex post market surveillance activities that can be integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms and procedures under the relevant Union financial services legislation. It is appropriate to envisage that, when acting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013\/36\/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) established by Council Regulation No 1024\/2013, should report, without delay, to the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s prudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. To further enhance the consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013\/36\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council1, it is also appropriate to integrate some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk management, post marketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and procedures under Directive 2013\/36\/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on eployers of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013\/36\/EU. The same regime should apply to insurance and re-insurance undertakings and insurance holding companies under Directive 2009\/138\/EU (Solvency II) and the insurance intermediaries under Directive 2016\/97\/EU and other types of financial institutions subject to requirements regarding internal governance, arrangements or processes established pursuant to the relevant Union financial services legislation to ensure consistency and equal treatment in the financial sector. (80-x) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III insofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III should have effective investigative and corrective powers, including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance authorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence. Any limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016\/680. No exclusion on disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should affect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation. (80x) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be able to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market surveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States. Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the 2019\/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations. (80y) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level as regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping competences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model and system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 for this purpose. In all other cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI systems. However, for general purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high risk, market surveillance authorities should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general purpose AI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding mutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 should apply by analogy. (80z) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the powers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards general purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI systems. (80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general purpose AI models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the information necessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from a provider. (80z+2) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by requesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures, including risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting the making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in case needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of general-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation.",

A contractual term concerning the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high risk AI system or the remedies for the breach or the termination of related obligations which has been unilaterally imposed by an enterprise on a SME or startup shall not be binding on the latter enterprise if it is unfair. 2. A contractual term is not to be considered unfair where it arises from applicable Union law. 3. A contractual term is unfair if it is of such a nature that it objectively impairs the ability of the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed to protect its legitimate commercial interest in the information in question or its use grossly deviates from good commercial practice in the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system, contrary to good faith and fair dealing or creates a significant imbalance between the rights and the obligations of the parties in the contract. A contractual term is also unfair if it has the effect of shifting penalties referred to in Article 71 or associated litigation costs across parties to the contract, as referred to in Article 71(8). 4. A contractual term is unfair for the purposes of this Article if its object or effect is to: (a) exclude or limit the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term for intentional acts or gross negligence; (b) exclude the remedies available to the party upon whom the term has been unilaterally imposed in the case of non-performance of contractual obligations or the liability of the party that unilaterally imposed the term in the case of a breach of those obligations; (c) give the party that unilaterally imposed the term the exclusive right to determine whether the technical documentation, information supplied are in conformity with the contract or to interpret any term of the contract. 5. A contractual term shall be considered to be unilaterally imposed within the meaning of this Article if it has been supplied by one contracting party and the other contracting party has not been able to influence its content despite an attempt to negotiate it. The contracting party that supplied a contractual term shall bears the burden of proving that that term has not been unilaterally imposed. 6. Where the unfair contractual term is severable from the remaining terms of the contract, those remaining terms shall remain binding. The party that supplied the contested term shall not argue that the term is an unfair term. 7. This Article shall apply to all new contracts entered into force after ... [date of entry into force of this Regulation]. Businesses shall review existing contractual obligations that are subject to this Regulation by …[three years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation]. 8.

For the purpose of paragraph 1, the provider of a foundation model shall: (a) demonstrate through appropriate design, testing and analysis the identification, the reduction and mitigation of reasonably foreseeable risks to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment and democracy and the rule of law prior and throughout development with appropriate methods such as with the involvement of independent experts, as well as the documentation of remaining non mitigable risks after development (b) process and incorporate only datasets that are subject to appropriate data governance measures for foundation models, in particular measures to examine the suitability of the data sources and possible biases and appropriate mitigation (c) design and develop the foundation model in order to achieve throughout its lifecycle appropriate levels of performance, predictability, interpretability, corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity assessed through appropriate methods such as model evaluation with the involvement of independent experts, documented analysis, and extensive testing during conceptualisation, design, and development; (d) design and develop the foundation model, making use of applicable standards to reduce energy use, resource use and waste, as well as to increase energy efficiency, and the overall efficiency of the system, whithout prejudice to relevant existing Union and national law. This obligation shall not apply before the standards referred to in Article 40 are published. Foundation models shall be designed with capabilities enabling the measurement and logging of the consumption of energy and resources, and, where technically feasible, other environmental impact the deployment and use of the systems may have over their entire lifecycle; (e) draw up extensive technical documentation and intelligible instructions for use, in order to enable the downstream providers to comply with their obligations pursuant to Articles 16 and 28(1);. (f) establish a quality management system to ensure and document compliance with this Article, with the possibility to experiment in fulfilling this requirement, (g) register that foundation model in the EU database referred to in Article 60, in accordance with the instructions outlined in Annex VIII point C. When fulfilling those requirements, the generally acknowledged state of the art shall be taken into account, including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or common specifications, as well as the latest assessment and measurement methods, reflected in particular in benchmarking guidance and capabilities referred to in Article 58a; 3. Providers of foundation models shall, for a period ending 10 years after their foundation models have been placed on the market or put into service, keep the technical documentation referred to in paragraph 2(e) at the disposal of the national competent authorities 4. Providers of foundation models used in AI systems specifically intended to generate, with varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex text, images, audio, or video (“generative AI”) and providers who specialise a foundation model into a generative AI system, shall in addition a) comply with the transparency obligations outlined in Article 52 (1), b) train, and where applicable, design and develop the foundation model in such a way as to ensure adequate safeguards against the generation of content in breach of Union law in line with the generally-acknowledged state of the art, and without prejudice to fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, c) without prejudice to Union or national or Union legislation on copyright, document and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary of the use of training data protected under copyright law.",

Each use shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the investigation of a specific criminal offence.

(j) the governance system the deployer will put in place, including human oversight, complaint handling and redress. 2.

If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that the criteria listed in paragraph 1 are not longer met, it shall conduct a new fundamental rights impact assessment. 4. In the course of the impact assessment, the deployer, with the exception of SMEs, shall shall notify national supervisory authority and relevant stakeholders and shall, to best extent possible, involve representatives of the persons or groups of persons that are likely to be affected by the high risk AI system, as identified in paragraph 1, including but not limited to: equality bodies, consumer protection agencies, social partners and data protection agencies, with a view to receiving input into the impact assessment. The deployer shall allow a period of six weeks for bodies to respond. SMEs may voluntarily apply the provisions laid down in this paragraph. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), public authorities may be exempted from this obligations. 5. The deployer that is a public authority or an undertaking referred to in Article 51(1a) (b) shall publish a summary of the results of the impact assessment as part of the registration of use pursuant to their obligation under Article 51(2). 6. Where the deployer is already required to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016\/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with the data protection impact assessment. The data protection impact assessment shall be published as an addendum.",
        "draft":"Article 29a Fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems 1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system as defined in Article 6(2) into use, with the exception of AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are bodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services and operators deploying high-risk systems referred to in Annex III, point 5, b) and d) shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of the system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of: a) a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose; b) a description of the period of time and frequency in which each high-risk AI system is intended to be used c) the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context; d) the specific risks of harm likely to impact the categories of persons or group of persons identified pursuant point (c), taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to article 13; e) a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions of use; f) the measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including their arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms. 2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the factors listed in paragraph 1change are or no longer up to date, the deployer will take the necessary steps to update the information. 3. Once the impact assessment has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of the results of the assessment, submitting the filled template referred to in paragraph 5 as a part of the notification. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), deployers may be exempted from these obligations. 4. If any of the obligations laid down in this article are already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016\/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with that data protection impact assessment. 5. The AI Office shall develop a template for a questionnaire, including through an automated tool, to facilitate users to implement the obligations of this Article in a simplified manner.",

Any information and documentation obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Article, including trade secrets, shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in Article 70. New article 52ca Authorised representative 1. Prior to placing a general purpose AI model on the Union market providers established outside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative which is established in the Union and shall enable it to perform its tasks under this Regulation. 2. The authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the provider. It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the AI Office upon request, in one of the official languages of the institutions of the Union. For the purpose of this Regulation, the mandate shall empower the authorised representative to carry out the following tasks: a) verify that the technical documentation specified in Annex IXa has been drawn up and all obligations referred to in Articles 52c and, where applicable, Article 52d have been fulfilled by the provider; b) keep a copy of the technical documentation at the disposal of the AI Office and national competent authorities, for a period ending 10 years after the model has been placed on the market and the contact details of the provider by which the authorised representative has been appointed; c) provide the AI Office, upon a reasoned request, with all the information and documentation, including that kept according to point (a), necessary to demonstrate the compliance with the obligations in this Title; d) cooperate with the AI Office and national competent authorities, upon a reasoned request, on any action the latter takes in relation to the general-purpose AI model with systemic risks, including when the model is integrated into AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the Union; 3. The mandate shall empower the authorised representative to be addressed, in addition to or instead of the provider, by the AI Office or the national competent authorities, on all issues related to ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 4. The authorised representative shall terminate the mandate if it considers or has reason to consider that the provider acts contrary to its obligations under this Regulation. In such a case, it shall also immediately inform the AI Office about the termination of the mandate and the reasons thereof. 5. The obligation set out in this article shall not apply to providers of general purpose AI models that are made accessible to the public under a free and open source licence that allows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available, unless the general purpose AI models present systemic risks.",

The Commission shall have exclusive powers to supervise and enforce Chapter\/Title [general purpose AI models] taking into account the procedural guarantees by virtue of Article H. The Commission shall entrust the implementation of these tasks to the European AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between Member States and the Union based on the Treaties. 2. Without prejudice to Article 63a paragraph 3, market surveillance authorities may request to the Commission to exercise the powers laid down in this Chapter, where this is necessary and proportionate to assist with the fulfilment of their tasks under this Regulation. Article B Monitoring actions For the purposes of carrying out the tasks assigned to it under this Chapter, the AI Office may take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation and compliance with this Regulation by providers of general purpose AI models, including adherence to approved codes of practice. 2. Downstream providers shall have the right to lodge a complaint alleging an infringement of this Regulation. A complaint shall be duly reasoned and at least indicate: (a) the point of contact of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned; (b) description of the relevant facts, the provisions of this Regulation concerned and the reason why the downstream provider considers that the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned infringed this Regulation; (c) any other information that the downstream provider that sent the request considers relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative. Article C Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel 1. The scientific panel may provide a qualified alert to the AI Office where it has reason to suspect that (a) a general purpose AI model poses concrete identifiable risk at Union level; or (b) a general purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in Article [Classification of general purpose AI models with systemic risk…]. 2. Upon such qualified alert, the Commission, through the AI Office and after having informed the AI Board, may exercise the powers laid down in this Chapter for the purpose of assessing the matter. The AI Office shall inform the Board of any measure according to Articles [D-H]. 3. A qualified alert shall be duly reasoned and at least indicate: (a) the point of contact of the provider of the general purpose AI model with systemic risk concerned; (b) a description of the relevant facts and reasons for the suspicion of the scientific panel; (c) any other information that the scientific panel considers relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative. Article D Power to request documentation and information 1. The Commission may request the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned to provide the documentation drawn up by the provider according to Article [Obligations for providers of general purpose AI models] and [Obligations on providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risk] or any additional information that is necessary for the purpose of assessing compliance of the provider with this Regulation. 2. Before the request for information is sent, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model. 3. Upon a duly substantiated request from the scientific panel, the Commission may issue a request for information to a provider of a general purpose AI model, where the access to information is necessary and proportionate for the fulfilment of the tasks of the scientific panel according to Article [Scientific panel](2). 4. The request for information shall state the legal basis and the purpose of the request, specifying what information is required and set the period within which the information is to be provided, and the fines provided for in Article [fines] for supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information. 5. The provider of the general purpose AI model concerned or their representatives and, in the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where they have no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their constitution shall supply the information requested on behalf of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned. Lawyers duly authorised to act may supply the information on behalf of their clients. The latter shall remain fully responsible if the information supplied is incomplete, incorrect or misleading. Article E Power to conduct evaluations 1. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general purpose AI model concerned (a) to assess compliance of the provider with the obligations under this Regulation, where the information gathered pursuant to Article D [Power to request information] is insufficient; or (b) to investigate systemic risks at Union level of general purpose AI models with systemic risk, in particular following a qualified report from the scientific panel in accordance with point (c) of Article [Enforcement of obligations on providers of general purpose AI models and general purpose AI models with systemic risk](3) . 2. The Commission may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel pursuant to Article [scientific panel of independent experts]. All independent experts appointed for this task shall meet the criteria outlined in Article 58b, paragraph 2. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the Commission may request access to the general purpose AI model concerned through application programming interfaces (‘API’) or further appropriate technical means and tools, including through source code. 4. The request for access shall state the legal basis, the purpose and reasons of the request and set the period within which the access is to be provided, and the fines provided for in Article [fines] for failure to provide access. 5. The providers of the general purpose AI model concerned and, in the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where they have no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their constitution shall provide the access requested on behalf of the provider of the general purpose AI model concerned. 6. The modalities and the conditions of the evaluations, including the modalities for involving independent experts and the procedure for the selection of the latter, shall be set out in implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article xx(x). 7. Prior to requesting access to the general purpose AI model concerned, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model to gather more information on the internal testing of the model, internal safeguards for preventing systemic risks, and other internal procedures and measures the provider has taken to mitigate such risks. Article F Power to request measures 1. Where necessary and appropriate, the Commission may request providers to (a) take appropriate measures to comply with the obligations set out in Title\/Chapter [Obligations for provider of general purpose AI models]; (b) require a provider to implement mitigation measures, where the evaluation carried out in accordance with Article [Power to conduct evaluations] has given rise to serious and substantiated concern of a systemic risk at Union level; (c) restrict the making available on the market, withdraw or recall the model. 2. Before a measure is requested, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general purpose AI model. 3. If, during the structured dialogue under paragraph 2, the provider of the general purpose AI model with systemic risk offers commitments to implement mitigation meausres to address a systemic risk at Union level, the Commission may by decision make these commitments binding and declare that there are no further grounds for action. Article H Procedural rights of economic operators of the general purpose AI model Article 18 of the Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 apply by analogy to the providers of the general purpose AI model without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for in this Regulation.",

The Commission may impose on providers of general purpose AI models fines not exceeding 3% of its total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year or 15 million EUR whichever is higher. Fines should be imposed one year after the entry into application of the relevant provisions in this Regulation in order to allow providers sufficient time to adapt when the Commission finds that the provider intentionally or negligently: (a) infringes the relevant provisions of this Regulation; (b) fails to comply with a request for document or information pursuant to Article [Power to request documentation and information], or supply of incorrect, incomplete or misleading information; (b) fails to comply with a measure requested under Article [Power to request measures]; (c) fails to make available to the Commission access to the general purpose AI model or general purpose AI model with systemic risk with a view to conduct an evaluation pursuant to Article [Power to conduct evaluations]. In fixing the amount of the fine or periodic penalty payment, regard shall be had to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking due account of the principles of proportionality and appropriateness. The Commission shall also into account commitments made in accordance with Article F(3) or in relevant codes of practice in accordance with Article [Codes of practice]. 2. Before adopting the decision pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall communicate its preliminary findings to the provider of the general purpose AI model or general purpose AI model with systemic risk and give opportunity to be heard. 2a. Fines imposed in accordance with this article shall be proportionate, dissuasive and effective. 2b. The information on the fines shall be also communicated to the Board as appropriate. 3. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have unlimited jurisdiction to review decisions whereby the Commission has fixed a fine. It may cancel, reduce or increase the fine imposed. 4. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the modalities and practical arrangements for the proceedings in view of possible adoptions of decisions pursuant to paragraph 1. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article xx(x).",
