The sandboxing programme shall be rolled out in a phased fashion, with the various phases launched by the Commission upon success of the previous phase. The sandboxing programme will have a built-in impact assessment procedure to facilitate the review of cost-effectiveness against the agreed-upon objectives. This assessment shall be drafted with input from Member States based on their experiences and shall be included as part of the Annual Report submitted by the Commission to the European Artificial Intelligence Board.
