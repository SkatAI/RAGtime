== Article 5: Prohibited Artificial Intelligence Practices
1. The following artificial intelligence practices shall be prohibited:
(a) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting a person’s or a group of persons’ behaviour by appreciably impairing the person’s ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing the person to take a decision that that person would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;
(b) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of that person or a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;
(ba) the placing on the market or putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of biometric categorisation systems that categorise individually natural persons based on their biometric data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation.
This prohibition does not cover any labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets, such as images, based on biometric data or categorizing of biometric data in the area of law enforcement;
(c) the placing on the market, putting into service or use of AI systems for the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups thereof over a certain period of time based on their social behaviour or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with the social score leading to either or both of the following:
(i) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected;
(ii) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups thereof that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity;
(d) the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement unless and in as far as such use is strictly necessary for one of the following objectives:
(i) the targeted search for specific victims of abduction, trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of human beings as well as search for missing persons;
(ii) the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons or a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a terrorist attack;
(iii) the localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed a criminal offence, for the purposes of conducting a criminal investigation, prosecution or executing a criminal penalty for offences, referred to in Annex IIa and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years. This paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions in Article 9 of the GDPR for the processing of biometric data for purposes other than law enforcement.
(da) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess or predict the risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics. This prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support the human assessment of the involvement of a person in a criminal activity, which is already based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to a criminal activity;
(db) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage;
(dc) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI systems to infer emotions of a natural person in the areas of workplace and education institutions except in cases where the use of the AI system is intended to be put in place or into the market for medical or safety reasons.
1a. This Article shall not affect the prohibitions that apply where an artificial intelligence practice infringes other Union law.
2. The use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement for any of the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 point (d) shall only be deployed for the purposes under paragraph 1, point (d) to confirm the specifically targeted individual’s identity and it shall take into account the following elements:
(a) the nature of the situation giving rise to the possible use, in particular the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm caused in the absence of the use of the system;

The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces shall only be authorised if the law enforcement authority has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment as provided for in Article 29a and has registered the system in the database according to Article 51. However, in duly justified cases of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without the registration, provided that the registration is completed without undue delay.
3. As regards paragraphs 1, point (d) and 2, each use for the purpose of law enforcement of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 4. However, in a duly justified situation of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without an authorisation provided that such authorisation shall be requested without undue delay, at the latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, its use shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the data, as well as the results and outputs of this use shall be immediately discarded and deleted.
The competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding shall only grant the authorisation where it is satisfied, based on objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system at issue is necessary for and proportionate to achieving one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, point (d), as identified in the request and, in particular, remains limited to what is strictly necessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope. In deciding on the request, the competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding shall take into account the elements referred to in paragraph 2. It shall be ensured that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken by the judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding solely based on the output of the remote biometric identification system.
3a. Without prejudice to paragraph 3, each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes shall be notified to the relevant market surveillance authority and the national data protection authority in accordance with the national rules referred to in paragraph 4. The notification shall as a minimum contain the information specified under paragraph 5 and shall not include sensitive operational data.
4. A Member State may decide to provide for the possibility to fully or partially authorise the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement within the limits and under the conditions listed in paragraphs 1, point (d), 2 and 3. Member States concerned shall lay down in their national law the necessary detailed rules for the request, issuance and exercise of, as well as supervision and reporting relating to, the authorisations referred to in paragraph 3. Those rules shall also specify in respect of which of the objectives listed in paragraph 1, point (d), including which of the criminal offences referred to in point (iii) thereof, the competent authorities may be authorised to use those systems for the purpose of law enforcement. Member States shall notify those rules to the Commission at the latest 30 days following the adoption thereof. Member States may introduce, in accordance with Union law, more restrictive laws on the use of remote biometric identification systems.
5. National market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities of Member States that have been notified of the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes pursuant to paragraph 3a shall submit to the Commission annual reports on such use. For that purpose, the Commission shall provide Member States and national market surveillance and data protection authorities with a template, including information on the number of the decisions taken by competent judicial authorities or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding upon requests for authorisations in accordance with paragraph 3 and their result.
6. The Commission shall publish annual reports on the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes based on aggregated data in Member States based on the annual reports referred to in paragraph 5, which shall not include sensitive operational data of the related law enforcement activities.

** Chapter 1: CLASSIFICATION OF AI SYSTEMS AS HIGH-RISK

== Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems
1. Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently from the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II;
(b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II.
2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in Annex III shall also be considered high-risk.
2a. By derogation from paragraph 2 AI systems shall not be considered as high risk if they do not pose a significant risk of harm, to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making. This shall be the case if one or more of the following criteria are fulfilled:
(a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;
(b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity;
(c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or
(d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use cases listed in Annex III.
Notwithstanding first subparagraph of this paragraph, an AI system shall always be considered high-risk if the AI system performs profiling of natural persons.
2b. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in Article 51(1a). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment.
2c. The Commission shall, after consulting the AI Board, and no later than 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation, provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this article completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases on AI systems in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 82a.
2d. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to amend the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts adding new criteria to those laid down in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a, or modifying them, only where there is concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall under the scope of Annex III but that do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety and fundamental rights.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts deleting any of the criteria laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a where there is concrete and reliable evidence that this is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the Union.
Any amendment to the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) set out in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a shall not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the Union.

1. Any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party shall be considered a provider of a high-risk AI system for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to the obligations of the provider under Article 16, in any of the following circumstances:
(a) they put their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise;
(b) they make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service and in a way that it remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6;
(ba) they modify the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service in such manner that the AI system becomes a high risk AI system in accordance with Article 6.
2. Where the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) to (ba) occur, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service shall no longer be considered a provider of that specific AI system for the purposes of this Regulation. This former provider shall closely cooperate and shall make available the necessary information and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding the compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems. This paragraph shall not apply in the cases where the former provider has expressly excluded the change of its system into a high-risk system and therefore the obligation to hand over the documentation.
2a. For high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products to which the legal acts listed in Annex II, section A apply, the manufacturer of those products shall be considered the provider of the high-risk AI system and shall be subject to the obligations under Article 16 under either of the following scenarios:
(i) the high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer;
(ii) the high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer after the product has been placed on the market.
2b. The provider of a high risk AI system and the third party that supplies an AI system, tools, services, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system shall, by written agreement, specify the necessary information, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider of the high risk AI system to fully comply with the obligations set out in this Regulation.

1. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure they use such systems in accordance with the instructions of use accompanying the systems, pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 5 of this Article.
1a. To the extent deployers exercise control over the high-risk AI system, they shall ensure that the natural persons assigned to ensure human oversight of the high-risk AI systems have the necessary competence, training and authority as well as the necessary support.
2. The obligations in paragraph 1 and 1a, are without prejudice to other deployer obligations under Union or national law and to the deployer’s discretion in organising its own resources and activities for the purpose of implementing the human oversight measures indicated by the provider.
3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and 1a, to the extent the deployer exercises control over the input data, that deployer shall ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently representative in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.
4. Deployers shall monitor the operation of the high-risk AI system on the basis of the instructions of use and when relevant, inform providers in accordance with Article 61. When they have reasons to consider that the use in accordance with the instructions of use may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1) they shall, without undue delay, inform the provider or distributor and relevant market surveillance authority and suspend the use of the system. They shall also immediately inform first the provider, and then the importer or distributor and relevant market surveillance authorities when they have identified any serious incident. If the deployer is not able to reach the provider, Article 62 shall apply mutatis mutandis. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers of AI systems which are law enforcement authorities.
For deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation, the monitoring obligation set out in the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be fulfilled by complying with the rules on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms pursuant to the relevant financial service legislation.
5. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically generated by that high-risk AI system to the extent such logs are under their control for a period appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system, of at least six months, unless provided otherwise in applicable Union or national law, in particular in Union law on the protection of personal data.
Deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation shall maintain the logs as part of the documentation kept pursuant to the relevant Union financial service legislation.
(a) Prior to putting into service or use a high-risk AI system at the workplace, deployers who are employers shall inform workers representatives and the affected workers that they will be subject to the system. This information shall be provided, where applicable, in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in Union and national law and practice on information of workers and their representatives.
(b) Deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities or Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies shall comply with the registration obligations referred to in Article 51. When they find that the system that they envisage to use has not been registered in the EU database referred to in Article 60 they shall not use that system and shall inform the provider or the distributor.
6. Where applicable, deployers of high-risk AI systems shall use the information provided under Article 13 to comply with their obligation to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.
6a. Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016/680, in the framework of an investigation for the targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a criminal offence, the deployer of an AI system for post-remote biometric identification shall request an authorisation, prior, or without undue delay and no later than 48 hours, by a judicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to judicial review, for the use of the system, except when the system is used for the initial identification of a potential suspect based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to the offence. Each use shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the investigation of a specific criminal offence.
If the requested authorisation provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is rejected, the use of the post remote biometric identification system linked to that authorisation shall be stopped with immediate effect and the personal data linked to the use of the system for which the authorisation was requested shall be deleted.
In any case, such AI system for post remote biometric identification shall not be used for law enforcement purposes in an untargeted way, without any link to a criminal offence, a criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal offence or the search for a specific missing person.
It shall be ensured that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken by the law enforcement authorities solely based on the output of these post remote biometric identification systems.
This paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10 of the Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Article 9 of the GDPR for the processing of biometric data.
Regardless of the purpose or deployer, each use of these systems shall be documented in the relevant police file and shall be made available to the relevant market surveillance authority and the national data protection authority upon request, excluding the disclosure of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. This subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the powers conferred by the Directive 2016/680 to supervisory authorities.
Deployers shall, in addition, submit annual reports to the relevant market surveillance and national data protection authorities on the uses of post-remote biometric identification systems, excluding the disclosure of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. The reports can be aggregated to cover several deployments in one operation.
Member States may introduce, in accordance with Union law, more restrictive laws on the use of post remote biometric identification systems.
6b. Without prejudice to Article 52, deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III that make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons shall inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high-risk AI system. For high risk AI systems used for law enforcement purposes Article 13 of Directive 2016/680 shall apply.
6c. Deployers shall cooperate with the relevant national competent authorities on any action those authorities take in relation with the high-risk system in order to implement this Regulation.

== Article 29a: Fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems
1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system as defined in Article 6(2), with the exception of AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are bodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services and operators deploying high-risk systems referred to in Annex III, point 5, (b) and (ca) shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of the system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of:
(a) a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;
(b) a description of the period of time and frequency in which each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;
(c) the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;
(d) the specific risks of harm likely to impact the categories of persons or group of persons identified pursuant point (c), taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to Article 13;
(e) a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions of use;
(f) the measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including their arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.
2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the factors listed in paragraph 1 change are or no longer up to date, the deployer will take the necessary steps to update the information.
3. Once the impact assessment has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of the results of the assessment, submitting the filled template referred to in paragraph 5 as a part of the notification. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), deployers may be exempted from these obligations.
4. If any of the obligations laid down in this article are already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with that data protection impact assessment.
5. The AI Office shall develop a template for a questionnaire, including through an automated tool, to facilitate deployers to implement the obligations of this Article in a simplified manner.

When a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall inform the Commission thereof with a detailed explanation and the Commission shall assess that information and, if appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in question.

== Article 42: Presumption of conformity with certain requirements
1. High-risk AI systems that have been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which they are intended to be used shall be presumed to be in compliance with the respective requirements set out in Article 10(4).
2. High-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council1and the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to be in compliance with the cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or statement of conformity or parts thereof cover those requirements.

== Article 43: Conformity assessment
1. For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III, where, in demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or, where applicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, the provider shall opt for one of the following procedures:
(a) the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI; or
(b) the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical documentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in Annex VII.
In demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in Annex VII in the following cases:
(a) where harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, do not exist and common specifications referred to in Article 41 are not available;
(aa) the provider has not applied or has applied only in part the harmonised standard;
(b) where the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist but the provider has not applied them;
(c) where one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been published with a restriction and only on the part of the standard that was restricted.
For the purpose of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII, the provider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, when the system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities as well as EU institutions, bodies or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in Article 63(5) or (6), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.
2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III providers shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI, which does not provide for the involvement of a notified body.
3. For high-risk AI systems, to which legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, apply, the provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment as required under those legal acts. The requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point 4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply.
For the purpose of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those legal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, provided that the compliance of those notified bodies with requirements laid down in Article 33(4), (9) and (10) has been assessed in the context of the notification procedure under those legal acts.
Where the legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, enable the manufacturer of the product to opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has applied all harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that manufacturer may make use of that option only if he has also applied harmonised standards or, where applicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, covering the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title.
4. High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure whenever they are substantially modified, regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be further distributed or continues to be used by the current deployer.
For high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into service, changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance that have been pre determined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part of the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of Annex IV, shall not constitute a substantial modification.
5. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 for the purpose of updating Annexes VI and Annex VII in light of technical progress.
6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 in order to subject high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III to the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII or parts thereof. The Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the effectiveness of the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI in preventing or minimizing the risks to health and safety and protection of fundamental rights posed by such systems as well as the availability of adequate capacities and resources among notified bodies.

## TITLE IV: TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS AND DEPLOYERS OF CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS

== Article 52: Transparency obligations for providers and users of certain AI systems and GPAI models
1. Providers shall ensure that AI systems intended to directly interact with natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that the concerned natural persons are informed that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into account the circumstances and the context of use. This obligation shall not apply to AI systems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties unless those systems are available for the public to report a criminal offence.
1a. Providers of AI systems, including GPAI systems, generating synthetic audio, image, video or text content, shall ensure the outputs of the AI system are marked in a machine readable format and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated. Providers shall ensure their technical solutions are effective, interoperable, robust and reliable as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account specificities and limitations of different types of content, costs of implementation and the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art, as may be reflected in relevant technical standards. This obligation shall not apply to the extent the AI systems perform an assistive function for standard editing or do not substantially alter the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof, or where authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences.
2. Deployers of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system shall inform of the operation of the system the natural persons exposed thereto and process the personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2016/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/280, as applicable. This obligation shall not apply to AI systems used for biometric categorization and emotion recognition, which are permitted by law to detect, prevent and investigate criminal offences, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties, and in compliance with Union law.
3. Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates image, audio or video content constituting a deep fake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offence. Where the content forms part of an evidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional analogous work or programme, the transparency obligations set out in this paragraph are limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work.
Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates text which is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text has been artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences or where the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and where a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content.
3a. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be provided to the concerned natural persons in a clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first interaction or exposure. The information shall respect the applicable accessibility requirements.
4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in Title III of this Regulation and shall be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for users of AI systems laid down in Union or national law.
4a. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content. The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts to approve these codes of practice in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 52e paragraphs 6-8. If it deems the code is not adequate, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act specifying the common rules for the implementation of those obligations in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 73 paragraph 2.

## TITLE VIIIA: GENERAL PURPOSE AI MODELS

** Chapter 1: CLASSIFICATION RULES

== Article 52a: Classification of general purpose AI models as general purpose AI models with systemic risk
1. A general purpose AI model shall be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it meets any of the following criteria:
(a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks;
(b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert by the scientific panel that a general purpose AI model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those of point (a).
2. A general purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities pursuant to point a) of paragraph 1 when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25.
3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73(2) to amend the thresholds listed in the paragraphs above, as well as to supplement benchmarks and indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these thresholds to reflect the state of the art.

== Article 52b: Procedure
1. Where a general purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of Article 52a(1), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event within 2 weeks after those requirements are met or it becomes known that these requirements will be met. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirements have been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.
2. The provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of Article 52a(1) may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets the said requirements, the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks and therefore should not be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.
3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that the general purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments and the general purpose AI model shall be considered as general purpose AI model with systemic risk.
4. The Commission may designate a general purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert of the scientific panel pursuant to point (a) of Article 68h [Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel] (1) on the basis of criteria set out in Annex IXc. The Commission shall be empowered to specify and update the criteria in Annex IXc by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 74(2).
4a. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex IXc. Such request shall contain objective, concrete and new reasons that have arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after this decision.
5. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general purpose AI models with systemic risk is published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to respect and protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law.

** Chapter 2: OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS OF GENERAL PURPOSE AI MODELS

The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out their specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key performance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives and take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, including affected persons, at Union level.
5. The AI Office may invite all providers of general purpose AI models to participate in the codes of practice. For providers of general purpose AI models not presenting systemic risks this participation should be limited to obligations foreseen in paragraph 2 point (a) of this Article, unless they declare explicitly their interest to join the full code.
6. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report regularly to the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures taken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators as appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall take into account differences in size and capacity between different participants.
7. The AI Office and the AI Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the proper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether the codes of practice cover the obligations provided for in Articles 52c and 52d, including the issues listed in paragraph 2 of this Article, and shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of their objectives. They shall publish their assessment of the adequacy of the codes of practice. The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide to approve the code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 74(2).
8. As appropriate, the AI Office shall also encourage and facilitate review and adaptation of the codes of practice, in particular in light of emerging standards. The AI Office shall assist in the assessment of available standards.
9. If, by the time the Regulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised, or if the AI Office deems it is not adequate following under paragraph 7, the Commission may provide, by means of implementing acts, common rules for the implementation of the obligations provided for in Articles 52c and 52d, including the issues set out in paragraph 2.

Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant authorities and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under national or Union law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.
1d. AI regulatory sandboxes established under Article 53(1) of this Regulation shall, in accordance with Articles 53 and 53a, provide for a controlled environment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the prospective providers and the competent authority. Such regulatory sandboxes may include testing in real world conditions supervised in the sandbox.
1e. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support within the sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and Member States legislation supervised within the sandbox.
1f. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfil the requirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.
Upon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent authority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the sandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities carried out in the sandbox and the related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use such documentation to demonstrate the compliance with this Regulation through the conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this regard, the exit reports and the written proof provided by the national competent authority shall be taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a view to accelerate conformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent.
1fa. Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 70 and with the agreement of the sandbox provider/prospective provider, the European Commission and the Board shall be authorised to access the exit reports and shall take them into account, as appropriate, when exercising their tasks under this Regulation.
