Nor should it affect  concertation practices, the right to  negotiate, to conclude and enforce  collective agreement or to take  collective action in accordance with  national law and/or practice.

(5) A Union legal framework laying  down harmonised rules on artificial  intelligence is therefore needed to  foster the development, use and  uptake of artificial intelligence in the  internal market that at the same time  meets a high level of protection of  public interests, such as health and  safety and the protection of  
fundamental rights, as recognised  and protected by Union law. To  achieve that objective, rules  
regulating the placing on the market  and putting into service of certain AI  systems should be laid down, thus  ensuring the smooth functioning of  the internal market and allowing  those systems to benefit from the  principle of free movement of goods  and services. By laying down those  rules, this Regulation supports the  objective of the Union of being a  global leader in the development of  secure, trustworthy and ethical  artificial intelligence, as stated by  the European Council1, and it  ensures the protection of ethical  principles, as specifically requested  by the European Parliament2.

(6a) Machine learning approaches  focus on the development of  systems capable of learning and  inferring from data to solve an  application problem without being  explicitly programmed with a set of  step-by-step instructions from input  to output. Learning refers to the  computational process of  
optimizing from data the  
parameters of the model, which is a  mathematical construct generating  an output based on input data. The  
range of problems addressed by  machine learning typically involves  tasks for which other approaches  fail, either because there is no  suitable formalisation of the  
problem, or because the resolution  of the problem is intractable with

(6a) AI systems often have  
machine learning capacities that  allow them to adapt and perform  new tasks autonomously. Machine  learning refers to the computational  process of optimizing the  
parameters of a model from data,  which is a mathematical construct  generating an output based on  input data. Machine learning  approaches include, for instance,  supervised, unsupervised and  reinforcement learning, using a  variety of methods including deep  learning with neural networks. This  Regulation is aimed at addressing  new potential risks that may arise  by delegating control to AI systems,  in particular to those AI systems  that can evolve after deployment.  The function and outputs of many  of these AI systems are based on

(6b) Logic- and knowledge based  approaches focus on the  
development of systems with logical  reasoning capabilities on  
knowledge to solve an application  problem. Such systems typically  involve a knowledge base and an  inference engine that generates  outputs by reasoning on the  
knowledge base. The knowledge  base, which is usually encoded by  human experts, represents entities  and logical relationships relevant  for the application problem through  formalisms based on rules,  
ontologies, or knowledge graphs.  The inference engine acts on the

(9b) ‘AI literacy’ refers to skills,  knowledge and understanding that  allows providers, users and affected  persons, taking into account their  respective rights and obligations in  the context of this Regulation, to  make an informed deployment of  AI systems, as well as to gain  awareness about the opportunities  and risks of AI and possible harm it  can cause and thereby promote its  democratic control. AI literacy  should not be limited to learning  about tools and technologies, but  should also aim to equip providers  and users with the notions and  skills required to ensure compliance  with and enforcement of this  Regulation. It is therefore  
necessary that the Commission, the  Member States as well as providers  and users of AI systems, in  
cooperation with all relevant  stakeholders, promote the  
development of a sufficient level of  AI literacy, in all sectors of society,  for people of all ages, including

(9b) In order to obtain the greatest  benefits from AI systems while  protecting fundamental rights,  health and safety and to enable  democratic control, AI literacy  should equip providers, deployers  and affected persons with the  necessary notions to make informed  decisions regarding AI systems.  These notions may vary with regard  to the relevant context and can  include understanding the correct  application of technical elements  during the AI system’s development  phase, the measures to be applied  during its use, the suitable ways in  which to interpret the AI system’s  output, and, in the case of affected  persons, the knowledge necessary to  understand how decisions taken  with the assistance of AI will impact  them. In the context of the

introduction of appropriate follow up actions could contribute to  improving working conditions and  ultimately sustain the consolidation,  and innovation path of trustworthy  AI in the Union. The European  Artificial Intelligence Board should  support the Commission , to  
promote AI literacy tools, public  awareness and understanding of  the benefits, risks, safeguards,  rights and obligations in relation to  the use of AI systems. In  
cooperation with the relevant  stakeholders, the Commission and  the Member States should facilitate  the drawing up of voluntary codes  of conduct to advance AI literacy  among persons dealing with the  development, operation and use of  AI .

Moreover, it is necessary to ensure  that the Regulation does not

(12d) In the light of the nature and  complexity of the value chain for AI  systems, it is essential to clarify the  role of actors who may contribute to  the development of AI systems,  notably high-risk AI systems. In  particular, it is necessary to clarify  that general purpose AI systems are  AI systems that are intended by the  provider to perform generally  applicable functions, such as  image/speech recognition, and in a  plurality of contexts. They may be  used as high-risk AI systems by  themselves or be components of  other high risk AI systems.

In addition, the  providers of general purpose AI  systems, irrespective of whether  they may be used as high-risk AI  systems as such by other providers  or as components of high-risk AI  systems, should cooperate, as  appropriate, with the providers of  the respective high-risk AI systems  to enable their compliance with the  relevant obligations under this  Regulation and with the competent  authorities established under this  Regulation. In order to take into  account the specific characteristics  of general purpose AI systems and  the fast evolving market and  technological developments in the field, implementing powers should  be conferred on the Commission to  specify and adapt the application of  the requirements established under  this Regulation to general purpose  AI systems and to specify the  information to be shared by the  providers of general purpose AI  systems in order to enable the  providers of the respective high-risk  AI system to comply with their  obligations under this Regulation.
