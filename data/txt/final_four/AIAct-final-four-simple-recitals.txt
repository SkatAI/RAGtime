Recital 2
commission: (2) Artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured, while divergences hampering the free circulation of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.

parliament: (4a) Given the major impact that artificial intelligence can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for artificial intelligence and its regulatory framework to be developed according to Union values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter, and international human rights law. As a pre requisite, artificial intelligence should be a human-centric technology. It should not substitute human autonomy or assume the loss of individual freedom and should primarily serve the needs of the society and the common good. Safeguards should be provided to ensure the development and use of ethically embedded artificial intelligence that respects Union values and the Charter.

(4aa) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for all high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (2023\/C 23\/01) and the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.

commission:
council: (5a) The harmonised rules on the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with its New Legislative Framework approach, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, notably on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence all rights and remedies afforded by such Union law to consumers and other persons who may be negatively impacted by AI systems, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85\/374\/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, remain unaffected and fully applicable. On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such laws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the laws on the protection of minors (i.e. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legimitate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.

Recital 6
commission: (6) The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty, while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments. The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of the software, in particular the ability, for a given set of human-defined objectives, to generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions which influence the environment with which the system interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension. AI systems can be designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and be used on a stand alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non embedded). The definition of AI system should be complemented by a list of specific techniques and approaches used for its development, which should be kept up-to–date in the light of market and technological developments through the adoption of delegated acts by the Commission to amend that list.
council: (6) The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty, while providing the flexibility to accommodate future technological developments. The definition should be based on key functional characteristics of rtificial intelligence such as its learning, reasoning or modelling capabilities, distinguishing it from simpler software systems and programming approaches. In particular, for the purposes of this Regulation AI systems should have the ability, f n the basis of machine and\/or human-based data and inputs, to infer the way to achieve a set of inal objectives given to them by humans, using machine learning and\/or logic- and knowledge based approaches and to produce,outputs such as content for generative AI systems (e.g. text, video or images), predictions, recommendations,or decisions, influencing the environment with which the system interacts, be it in a physical or digital dimension. A system that uses rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations should not be considered an AI system. AI systems can be designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non embedded). The oncept of the autonomy of an AI system relates to the degree to which such a system functions without human involvement.
parliament: (6) The notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure legal certainty, harmonization and wide acceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate fhe rapid technological developments in this field. Moreover, it should be based on ey characteristics of p p rtificial intelligence, such as its learning, reasoning or modelling capabilities, so as to distinguish it from simpler software systems or programming approaches. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have at least some degree of independence of actions from human controls and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The term “machine based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can p p fperate according to explicit human-defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. The reference to predictions includes content, which is considered in this Regulation a form of prediction as one of the p ossible outputs produced by an AI system. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, meaning predictions, recommendations or decisions, respond to the objectives of the system, on the basis of inputs from said environment. Such output further influences said environment, even by merely introducing new information to it.
draft: (6) The notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate fhe rapid technological developments in this field. Moreover, it should be based on ey characteristics of rtificial intelligence systems, that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence A p f hysical and virtual environments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and\/or algorithms from inputs\/data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives; and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond basic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling. The term “machine-based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific ontext. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non embedded).

Recital 6a
commission:
council: (6a) Machine learning approaches focus on the development of systems capable of learning and inferring from data to solve an application problem without being explicitly programmed with a set of step-by-step instructions from input to output. Learning refers to the computational process of optimizing from data the parameters of the model, which is a mathematical construct generating an output based on input data. The range of problems addressed by machine learning typically involves tasks for which other approaches fail, either because there is no suitable formalisation of the problem, or because the resolution of the problem is intractable with non-learning approaches. Machine learning approaches include for instance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, using a variety of methods including deep learning with neural networks, statistical techniques for learning and inference (including for instance logistic regression, Bayesian estimation) and search and optimisation methods.

parliament: (6a) AI systems often have machine learning capacities that allow them to adapt and perform new tasks autonomously. Machine learning refers to the computational process of optimizing the parameters of a model from data, which is a mathematical construct generating an output based on input data. Machine learning approaches include, for instance, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, using a variety of methods including deep learning with neural networks. This Regulation is aimed at addressing new potential risks that may arise by delegating control to AI systems, in particular to those AI systems that can evolve after deployment. The function and outputs of many of these AI systems are based on abstract mathematical relationships that are difficult for humans to understand, monitor and trace back to specific inputs. These complex and opaque characteristics (black box element) impact accountability and explainability. Comparably simpler techniques such as knowledge-based approaches, Bayesian estimation or decision trees may also lead to legal gaps that need to be addressed by this Regulation, in particular when they are used in combination with machine learning approaches in hybrid systems.

Recital 6b
commission:
council: (6b) Logic- and knowledge based approaches focus on the development of systems with logical reasoning capabilities on knowledge to solve an application problem. Such systems typically involve a knowledge base and an inference engine that generates outputs by reasoning on the knowledge base. The knowledge base, which is usually encoded by human experts, represents entities and logical relationships relevant for the application problem through formalisms based on rules, ontologies, or knowledge graphs. The inference engine acts on the knowledge base and extracts new information through operations such as sorting, searching, matching or chaining. Logic- and knowledge based approaches include for instance knowledge representation, inductive (logic) programming, knowledge bases, inference and deductive engines, (symbolic) reasoning, expert systems and search and optimisation methods.

draft: (7b) The notion of biometric categorisation as used in this Regulation should be defined as assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorization systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can only be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.

commission: (8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge whether the targeted person will be present and can be identified, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Considering their different characteristics and manners in which they are used, as well as the different risks involved, a distinction should be made between ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.

Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive (scan) multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of a number of persons without their ctive involvement. Such a definition excludes verification\/authentication systems whose sole purpose would be to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be, as well as systems that are used to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, a device or premises. This exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to s remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a large number of persons.

This refers to emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or fatigue. It refers for example to systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents. It does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring emotions. These expressions can be basic facial expressions such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a person’s voice, for example a raised voice or whispering.

However, the mere fact that certain conditions for accessing a particular space may apply, such as admission tickets or age restrictions, does not mean that the space is not publicly accessible within the meaning of this Regulation. Consequently, in addition to public spaces such as streets, relevant parts of government buildings and most transport infrastructure, spaces such as cinemas, theatres, shops and shopping centres are normally also publicly accessible.

parliament: (9b) ‘AI literacy’ refers to skills, knowledge and understanding that allows providers, users and affected persons, taking into account their respective rights and obligations in the context of this Regulation, to make an informed deployment of AI systems, as well as to gain awareness about the opportunities and risks of AI and possible harm it can cause and thereby promote its democratic control. AI literacy should not be limited to learning about tools and technologies, but should also aim to equip providers and users with the notions and skills required to ensure compliance with and enforcement of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary that the Commission, the Member States as well as providers and users of AI systems, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, promote the development of a sufficient level of AI literacy, in all sectors of society, for people of all ages, including women and girls, and that progress in that regard is closely followed.
draft: (9b) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems. These notions may vary with regard to the relevant context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will impact them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board should support the Commission , to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI .

parliament: (10) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the Union and on international level, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to eployers of AI systems established within the Union. In order for the Union to be true to its fundamental values, AI systems intended to be used for practices that are considered unacceptable by this Regulation, should equally be deemed to be unacceptable outside the Union because of their particularly harmful effect to fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter. Therefore it is appropriate to prohibit the export of such AI systems to third countries by providers residing in the Union.

Recital 11
commission: (11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk and whose effects impact natural persons located in the Union. In those circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and users of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of international agreements concluded at national or European level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its Member States. Such agreements have been concluded bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations.
council: (11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk . In those circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union.

commission:
council: (12a) If and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU and by the specifities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that are subject to public international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i.e. military, defence or national security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e.g. civilian purposes, law enforcement, etc.), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.

draft:

Recital 12e
commission:
council: (12d) In the light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems, it is essential to clarify the role of actors who may contribute to the development of AI systems, notably high-risk AI systems. In particular, it is necessary to clarify that general purpose AI systems are AI systems that are intended by the provider to perform generally applicable functions, such as image\/speech recognition, and in a plurality of contexts. They may be used as high-risk AI systems by themselves or be components of other high risk AI systems. Therefore, due to their particular nature and in order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, such systems should be subject to proportionate and more specific requirements and obligations under this Regulation while ensuring a high level of protection of fundamental rights, health and safety. In addition, the providers of general purpose AI systems, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk AI systems as such by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems, should cooperate, as appropriate, with the providers of the respective high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the relevant obligations under this Regulation and with the competent authorities established under this Regulation. In order to take into account the specific characteristics of general purpose AI systems and the fast evolving market and technological developments in the field, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to specify and adapt the application of the requirements established under this Regulation to general purpose AI systems and to specify the information to be shared by the providers of general purpose AI systems in order to enable the providers of the respective high-risk AI system to comply with their obligations under this Regulation.

Recital 14a
commission:

parliament:
draft: (14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm . Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.

Recital 16
commission: (16) The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems intended to distort human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, should be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components individuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of children and people due to their age, physical or mental incapacities. They do so with the intention to materially distort the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person. The intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behaviour results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user. Research for legitimate purposes in relation to such AI systems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not amount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural persons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised ethical standards for scientific research.
council: (16) AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems aterially distorting human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components uch as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human perception or other subliminal techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision making or free choices in ways that people are not consciously aware of, or even if aware not able to control or resist, for example in cases of machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of specific group of persons due to their age, p isability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019\/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the bjective to or the effect of materially istorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical or phycological harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time. The intention to distort the behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user, meaning factors that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the user of the AI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the user to have the intention to cause the physical or psychological harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005\/29\/EC, notably that unfair commercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances, irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise. The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are p p carried out in accordance with he applicable medical standards fnd legislation. In addition, common and legitimate commercial practices that are in compliance with the applicable law should not in themselves be regarded as constituting harmful manipulative AI practices.
parliament: (16) The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, should be forbidden. This limitation should be understood to include neuro-technologies assisted by AI systems that are used to monitor, use, or influence neural data gathered through brain computer interfaces insofar as they are materially distorting the behaviour of a natural person in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person significant harm. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components individuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of individuals and specific groups of persons due to their known or predicted personality traits, age, physical or mental incapacities, social or economic situation. They do so with the intention to or the effect of materially istorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time. The intention to distort the behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user, such as factors that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the AI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause the significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices is complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005\/29\/EC, according to which unfair commercial practices are prohibited, irrespective of whether they carried out having recourse to AI systems or otherwise. In such setting, lawful commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that are in compliance with Union law should not in themselves be regarded as violating prohibition. Research for legitimate purposes in relation to such AI systems should not be stifled by the prohibition, if such research does not amount to use of the AI system in human-machine relations that exposes natural persons to harm and such research is carried out in accordance with recognised ethical standards for scientific research and on the basis of specific informed consent of the individuals that are exposed to them or, where applicable, of their legal guardian.

This could be for example, facilitated by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of person or a specific group of persons due to their age, p isability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019\/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities.

Such characteristics include gender, gender identity, race, ethnic origin, migration or citizenship status, political orientation, sexual orientation, religion, disability or any other grounds on which discrimination is prohibited under Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as under Article 9 of Regulation (EU)2016\/769. Such systems should therefore be prohibited.

Recital 18
commission: (18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.

parliament: (18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces f p is particularly intrusive o the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, nd can ultimately affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance, give parties deploying biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces a position of uncontrollable power and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights at the core to the Rule of Law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities. The use of those systems in publicly accessible places should therefore be prohibited. Similarly, AI systems used for the analysis of recorded footage of publicly accessible spaces through ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems should also be prohibited, unless there is pre-judicial authorisation for use in the context of law enforcement, when strictly necessary for the targeted search connected to a specific serious criminal offense that already took place, and only subject to a pre judicial authorisation.

Recital 19
commission: (19) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including missing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002\/584\/JHA1if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, of the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002\/584\/JHA, some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real time’ remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. _________ 1.

commission: (21) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use, except in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations seek to obtain an authorisation as soon as possible, whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier.

council:
parliament: (26a) AI systems used by law enforcement authorities or on their behalf to make predictions, profiles or risk assessments based on profiling of natural persons or data analysis based on personality traits and characteristics, including the person’s location, or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups of persons for the purpose of predicting the occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence(s) or other criminalised social behaviour or administrative offences, including fraud-predicition systems, hold a particular risk of discrimination against certain persons or groups of persons, as they violate human dignity as well as the key legal principle of presumption of innocence. Such AI systems should therefore be prohibited.
draft: (26a) In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the EU should always be judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-predicted behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics, such as nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, debt, their type of car, without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal activity based on objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. Therefore, risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess the risk of them offending or for predicting the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence solely based on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics should be prohibited. In any case, this prohibition does not refer to nor touch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the personality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk analytics to assess the risk of financial fraud by undertakings based on suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to predict the likelihood of localisation of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for example based on known trafficking routes.

council:
parliament: (26b) The indiscriminate and untargeted scraping of biometric data from social media or CCTV footage to create or expand facial recognition databases add to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy. The use of AI systems with this intended purpose should therefore be prohibited.
draft: (26b) The placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage should be prohibited, as this practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.

Recital 26c
commission:
council:
parliament: (26c) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to detect emotions, physical or physiological features such as facial expressions, movements, pulse frequency or voice. Emotions or expressions of emotions and perceptions thereof vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such technologies, are the limited reliability (emotion categories are neither reliably expressed through, nor unequivocally associated with, a common set of physical or physiological movements), the lack of specificity (physical or physiological expressions do not perfectly match emotion categories) and the limited generalisability (the effects of context and culture are not sufficiently considered). Reliability issues and consequently, major risks for abuse, may especially arise when deploying the system in real-life situations related to law enforcement, border management, workplace and education institutions. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used in these contexts to detect the emotional state of individuals should be prohibited.
draft: (26c) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or infer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalizability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. This prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.

Recital 27
commission: (27) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market or put into service if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any.

Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law, including fundamental rights, democracy, the rule or law or the environment. In order to ensure alignment with sectoral legislation and avoid duplications, requirements for high-risk AI systems should take into account sectoral legislation laying down requirements for high risk AI systems included in the scope of this Regulation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017\/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006\/42\/EC on Machinery. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any. Given the rapid pace of technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems, the list of high-risk areas and use-cases in Annex III should nonetheless be subject to permanent review through the exercise of regular assessment.

Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017\/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006\/42\/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any.

Recital 28
commission: (28) AI systems could produce adverse outcomes to health and safety of persons, in particular when such systems operate as components of products. Consistently with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, and non-discrimination, consumer protection, workers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption of innocence, right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight that children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the UNCRC General Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which require consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons.

commission: (32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems.

The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems. It is also important to clarify that within the high-risk scenarios referred to in Annex III there may be systems that do not lead to a significant risk to the legal interests protected under those scenarios, taking into account the output produced by the AI system. Therefore only when such output has a high degree of importance (i.e. is not purely accessory) in respect of the relevant action or decision so as to generate a significant risk to the legal interests protected, the AI system generating such output should be considered as high-risk. For instance, when the information provided by an AI systems to the human consists of the profiling of natural persons within the meaning of of Article 4(4) Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation (EU) 2018\/1725, such information should not typically be considered of accessory nature in the context of high risk AI systems as referred to in Annex III. However, if the output of the AI system has only negligible or minor relevance for human action or decision, it may be considered purely accessory, including for example, AI systems used for translation for informative purposes or for the management of documents.
parliament: (32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products and that are listed in one of the areas and use cases in Annex III, it is appropriate to classify them as high risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a ignificant risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons and, where the AI system is used as a safety component of a critical infrastructure, to the environment . Such significant risk of harm should be identified by assessing on the one hand the effect of such risk with respect to its level of severity, intensity, , probability of occurrence and uration combined altogether and on the other hand whether the risk can affect an individual, a plurality of persons or a particular group of persons. Such combination could for instance result in a high severity but low probability to affect a natural person, or a high probability to affect a group of persons with a low intensity over a long period of time, depending on the context. The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems.

commission:
council:
parliament: (32a) Providers whose AI systems fall under one of the areas and use cases listed in Annex III that consider their system does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment should inform the national supervisory authorities by submitting a reasoned notification. This could take the form of a one-page summary of the relevant information on the AI system in question, including its intended purpose and why it would not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment. The Commission should specify criteria to enable companies to assess whether their system would pose such risks, as well as develop an easy to use and standardised template for the notification. Providers should submit the notification as early as possible and in any case prior to the placing of the AI system on the market or its putting into service, ideally at the development stage, and they should be free to place it on the market at any given time after the notification. However, if the authority estimates the AI system in question was misclassified, it should object to the notification within a period of three months. The objection should be substantiated and duly explain why the AI system has been misclassified. The provider should retain the right to appeal by providing further arguments. If after the three months there has been no objection to the notification, national supervisory authorities could still intervene if the AI system presents a risk at national level, as for any other AI system on the market. National supervisory authorities should submit annual reports to the AI Office detailing the notifications received and the decisions taken.
draft: (32a) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred to pre defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the decision making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in Annex III should be considered to pose signficant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018\/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases of AI systems.

This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, sex or disabilities. Therefore, ‘real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk. In view of the risks that they pose, both types of remote biometric identification systems should be subject to specific requirements on logging capabilities and human oversight.

parliament: (33a) As biometric data constitute a special category of sensitive personal data in accordance with Regulation 2016\/679, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk several critical use-cases of biometric and biometrics-based systems. AI systems intended to be used for biometric identification of natural persons and AI systems intended to be used to make inferences about personal characteristics of natural persons on the basis of biometric or biometrics-based data, including emotion recognition systems, with the exception of those which are prohibited under this Regulation should therefore be classified as high-risk. This should not include AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, a device or premises (one to-one verification). Biometric and biometrics-based systems which are provided for under Union law to enable cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not be considered as posing a significant risk of harm to the health, safety and fundamental rights.
draft: (33a) As biometric data constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk several critical use-cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Therefore, remote biometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises. In addition, AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation according to sensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 based on biometric data, in so far as these are not prohibited under this Regulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not prohibited under this Regulation, should be classified as high-risk. Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not be considered as high risk systems.

AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or materially influence decisions on admission or assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or to evaluate persons on tests as part of or as a precondition for their education or to assess the appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influence the level of education and training that individuals will receive or be able to access or to monitor and detect prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be lassified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a person’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and used, such systems can be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.
draft: (35) Deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital education and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the necessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, to take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or admission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of education and training that individuals will receive or be able to access or for monitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests p should be lassified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a person’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and used, such systems can be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.

commission: (36) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment, notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions on promotion and termination and for task allocation, monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects and livelihoods of these persons. Relevant work-related contractual relationships should involve employees and persons providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme 2021.

commission: (37) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. In particular, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to discrimination of persons or groups and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic origins, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory impacts. Considering the very limited scale of the impact and the available alternatives on the market, it is appropriate to exempt AI systems for the purpose of creditworthiness assessment and credit scoring when put into service by small-scale providers for their own use. Natural persons applying for or receiving public assistance benefits and services from public authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, they may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy. Those systems should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. Finally, AI systems used to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property.

Natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy.

Finally, AI systems used to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property. AI systems are also increasingly used for risk assessment in relation to natural persons and pricing in the case of life and health insurance which, if not duly designed, developed and used, can lead to serious consequences for people’s life and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination. To ensure a consistent approach within the financial services sector, the above mentioned exception for micro or small enterprises for their own use should apply, insofar as they themselves provide and put into service an AI system for the purpose of selling their own insurance products.

Recital 38
commission: (38) Actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the activities in question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by law enforcement authorities for individual risk assessments, polygraphs and similar tools or to detect the emotional state of natural person, to detect ‘deep fakes’, for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in criminal proceedings, for predicting the occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence based on profiling of natural persons, or assessing personality traits and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, as well as for crime analytics regarding natural persons. AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities should not be considered high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.

Such qualification should not extend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks or allocation of resources.
draft: (40) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes should be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on democracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on its behalf to assist judicial authoritiesin researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be used by alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered high-risk when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects for the parties. The use of artificial intelligence tools can supportthe decision-making power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it, as the final decision making must remain a human driven activity and decision. Such qualification should not extend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks .

parliament: (40b) Considering the scale of natural persons using the services provided by social media platforms designated as very large online platforms, such online platforms can be used in a way that strongly influences safety online, the shaping of public opinion and discourse, election and democratic processes and societal concerns. It is therefore appropriate that AI systems used by those online platforms in their recommender systems are subject to this Regulation so as to ensure that the AI systems comply with the requirements laid down under this Regulation, including the technical requirements on data governance, technical documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness. Compliance with this Regulation should enable such very large online platforms to comply with their broader risk assessment and risk-mitigation obligations in Article 34 and 35 of Regulation EU 2022\/2065. The obligations in this Regulation are without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065 and should complement the obligations required under the Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065 when the social media platform has been designated as a very large online platform. Given the European-wide impact of social media platforms designated as very large online platforms, the authorities designated under Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065 should act as enforcement authorities for the purposes of enforcing this provision.

commission: (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on the Union market for users and affected persons, certain mandatory requirements should apply, taking into account the intended purpose of the use of the system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider.
council: (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on the Union market p, certain mandatory requirements should apply, taking into account the intended purpose of the use of the system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider. In particular, the risk management system should consist of a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process should ensure that the provider identifies and analyses the risks to the health, safety and fundamental rights of the persons who may be affected by the system in light of its intended purpose, including the possible risks arising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it operates, and accordingly adopts suitable risk management measures in the light of state of the art.
parliament: (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed or otherwise put into service on the Union market for eployers and affected persons, certain mandatory requirements should apply, taking into account the intended purpose the reasonably foreseeable misuse of the system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider. These requirements should be objective driven, fit for purpose, reasonable and effective, without adding undue regulatory burdens or costs on operators.
draft: (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed n the market or put into service nd to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply to high risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose nd the context of use of the AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.

draft: (42a) The risk management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process should be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of artificial intelligence systems on health, safety and fundamental rights. The risk management system should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation. This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse impacts and implements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable risks of artificial intelligence systems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light of its intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks arising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it operates. The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk management measures in the light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying reasonably foreseeable misuse of high risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider. This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training measures for the high-risk AI system by the provider to address them. The providers however are encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate.

Biases can for example be inherent in underlying datasets, especially when historical data is being used, introduced by the developers of the algorithms, or generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings. Results provided by AI systems are influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain vulnerable or ethnic groups, or racialised communities.

In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are essential when the processing of data involves significant risks to the fundamental rights of individuals. Providers and users of AI systems should implement state-of-the-art technical and organisational measures in order to protect those rights. Such measures should include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of increasingly available technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows valuable insights to be derived without the transmission between parties or unnecessary copying of the raw or structured data themselves.

The technical documentation should be kept up to date appropriately throughout the lifecycle of the AI system. AI systems can have a large important environmental impact and high energy consumption during their lifecyle. In order to better apprehend the impact of AI systems on the environment, the technical documentation drafted by providers should include information on the energy consumption of the AI system, including the consumption during development and expected consumption during use. Such information should take into account the relevant Union and national legislation. This reported information should be comprehensible, comparable and verifiable and to that end, the Commission should develop guidelines on a harmonised metholodogy for calculation and reporting of this information. To ensure that a single documentation is possible, terms and definitions related to the required documentation and any required documentation in the relevant Union legislation should be aligned as much as possible.

parliament: (46a) AI systems should take into account state-of-the art methods and relevant applicable standards to reduce the energy use, resource use and waste, as well as to increase their energy efficiency and the overall efficiency of the system. The environmental aspects of AI systems that are significant for the purposes of this Regulation are the energy consumption of the AI system in the development, training and deployment phase as well as the recording and reporting and storing of this data. The design of AI systems should enable the measurement and logging of the consumption of energy and resources at each stage of development, training and deployment. The monitoring and reporting of the emissions of AI systems must be robust, transparent, consistent and accurate. In order to ensure the uniform application of this Regulation and stable legal ecosystem for providers and deployers in the Single Market, the Commission should develop a common specification for the methodology to fulfil the reporting and documentation requirement on the consumption of energy and resources during development, training and deployment. Such common specifications on measurement methodology can develop a baseline upon which the Commission can better decide if future regulatory interventions are needed, upon conducting an impact assessment that takes into account existing law.

draft: (47) To address oncerns related to opacity nd complexity of certain AI systems f nd help deployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be required for high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into service. High-risk AI systems should be esigned in a manner to enable deployers to understand how the AI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations. High risk AI systems, should be accompanied by ppropriate information in the form of instructions of use. Such information should include he characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the AI system. These would cover information on possible known and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system, including eployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under which the AI system can lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the changes that have been pre-determined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on the relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the accompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision making by them. Among others, deployers should be in a better position to make the correct choice of the system they intend to use in the light of the obligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use the AI system correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and accessibility of the information included in the instructions of use , where appropriate, illustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target deployers. Instructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily understood by target deployers, as determined by the Member State concerned.

For this purpose, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role.

Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system.

In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in case of incorrect matches by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons.

parliament: (49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. Performance metrics and their expected level should be defined with the primary objective to mitigate risks and negative impact of the AI system. The expected level of erformance metrics should be communicated in a clear, transparent, easily understandable and intelligible way to the deployers. The declaration of performance metrics cannot be considered proof of future levels, but relevant methods need to be applied to ensure consistent levels during use While standardisation organisations exist to establish standards, coordination on benchmarking is needed to establish how these standardised requirements and characteristics of AI systems should be easured. The European Artificial Intelligence Office should bring together national and international metrology and benchmarking authorities and provide non binding guidance to address the technical aspects of how to measure the appropriate levels of performance and robustness.
draft: (49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in the light of their intended purpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. The Commission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due consideration of mitigation of risks and negative impacts of the AI system. The expected level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use. Providers are urged to communicate this information to deployers in a clear and easily understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements. The EU legislation on legal metrology, including on Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) and Non-automatic weighing instruments (NAWI) Directive, aims to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions. In this context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organisation, such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as appropriate, the development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI systems. In doing so, the Commission should take note and collaborate with international partners working on metrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to Artificial Intelligence.

commission: (50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be resilient against risks connected to the limitations of the system (e.g. errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations) as well as against malicious actions that may compromise the security of the AI system and result in harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.

They should be resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). High-risk AI systems should therefore be designed and developed with appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize that harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour, such as for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.

For this purpose, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital elements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under Regulation 2022\/0272, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation. The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022\/0272 and classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation. However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical products with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022\/0272. Therefore, by way of derogation from this rule, high-risk AI systems that fall within the scope of this Regulation and are also qualified as important and critical products with digital elements pursuant to Regulation 2022\/0272 and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI of this Regulation applies, are subject to the conformity assessment provisions of Regulation 2022\/0272 insofar as the essential cybersecurity requirements of Regulation 2022\/0272 are concerned. In this case, for all the other aspects covered by this Regulation the respective provisions on conformity assessment based on internal control set out in Annex VI of this Regulation should apply. Building on the knowledge and expertise of ENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to ENISA under the Regulation 2019\/1020 the European Commission should cooperate with ENISA on issues related to cybersecurity of AI systems.

Recital 54a
commission:
council: (54a) To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, any natural or legal person should be considered a provider of a new high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. For example, this would be the case if that person puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, or if that person modifies the intended purpose of an AI system which is not high-risk and is already placed on the market or put into service, in a way that makes the modified system a high risk AI system. These provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific provisions established in certain New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation with which this Regulation should apply jointly. For example, Article 16, paragraph 2 of Regulation 745\/2017, establishing that certain changes should not be considered modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements, should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices within the meaning of that Regulation.

draft: (56a) In the light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with New Legislative Framework principles, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate the compliance with this Regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the specific obligations of relevant operators along the value chain, such as importers and distributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems. In certain situations those operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore fulfil cumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles. For example, an operator could act as a distributor and an importer at the same time.

parliament: (57) In line with New Legislative Framework principles, specific obligations for relevant economic operators, such as importers and distributors, should be set to ensure legal certainty and facilitate regulatory compliance by those relevant operators.
draft: (57) I To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, any distributor, importer, deployer or other third party should be considered a provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise, or if that party make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service and in a way that it remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6, or if it modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high risk AI system in accordance with Article 6. These provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific provisions established in certain New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation with which this Regulation should apply jointly. For example, Article 16, paragraph 2 of Regulation 745\/2017, establishing that certain changes f should not be considered modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements, should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices within the meaning of that Regulation .

These parties have an important role in the value chain towards the provider of the high risk AI system into which their AI systems, tools, services, components or processes are integrated, and should provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary information, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider to fully comply with the obligations set out in this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual property rights or trade secrets.

It remains necessary to ensure information of workers and their representatives on the planned deployment of high-risk AI systems at the workplace in cases where the conditions for those information or information and consultation obligations in other legal instruments are not fulfilled. Moreover, such information right is ancillary and necessary to the objective of protecting fundamental rights that underlies this Regulation.

parliament: (58a) Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, risks can as well stem from how such AI systems are used. Deployers of high-risk AI system therefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected, complementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system. Deployers are best placed to understand how the high risk AI system will be used concretely and can therefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the development phase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the people or groups of people likely to be affected, including marginalised and vulnerable groups. Deployers should identify appropriate governance structures in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight, complaint-handling procedures and redress procedures, because choices in the governance structures can be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, the deployer of high-risk AI systems should therefore carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. The impact assessment should be accompanied by a detailed plan describing the measures or tools that will help mitigating the risks to fundamental rights identified at the latest from the time of putting it into use. If such plan cannot be identified, the deployer should refrain from putting the system into use. When performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify the national supervisory authority and, to the best extent possible relevant stakeholders as well as representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system in order to collect relevant information which is deemed necessary to perform the impact assessment and are encouraged to make the summary of their fundamental rights impact assessment publicly available on their online website. This obligations should not apply to SMEs which, given the lack of resrouces, might find it difficult to perform such consultation. Nevertheless, they should also strive to invole such representatives when carrying out their fundamental rights impact assessment.In addition, given the potential impact and the need for democratic oversight and scrutiny, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities or Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well deployers who are undertakings designated as a gatekeeper under Regulation (EU) 2022\/1925 should be required to register the use of any high-risk AI system in a public database. Other deployers may voluntarily register.

Deployers of high risk AI systems referred to in Annex III also play a critical role in informing natural persons and should, when they make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons , where applicable, inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high risk AI system. This information should include the intended purpose and the type of decisions it makes. The deployer should also inform the natural person about its right to an explanation provided under this Regulation. With regard to high risk AI systems used for law enforcement purposes, this obligation should be implemented in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2016\/680.

Post biometric identification systems should always be used in a way that is proportionate, legitimate and strictly necessary, and thus targeted, in terms of the individuals to be identified, the location, temporal scope and based on a closed dataset of legally acquired video footage. In any case, post remote biometric identification systems should not be used in the framework of law enforcement to lead to indiscriminate surveillance.

draft: (58g) In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private operators providing public services and operators deploying certain high risk AI system referred to in Annex III, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use . Services important for individuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in case of the materialisation of these risk.The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the fundamental rights of these persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including for example governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and designing measures to be taken in the case of materialization of the risks. The AI Office should develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.

Such contractual imbalances particularly harm micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as start-ups, unless they are owned or sub contracted by an enterprise which is able to compensate the sub contractor appropriately, as they are without a meaningful ability to negotiate the conditions of the contractual agreement, and may have no other choice than to accept ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ contractual terms. Therefore, unfair contract terms regulating the supply of tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high risk AI system or the remedies for the breach or the termination of related obligations should not be binding to such micro, small or medium-sized enterprises and start ups when they have been unilaterally imposed on them.

Therefore, not all contractual terms should be subject to an unfairness test, but only to those terms that are unilaterally imposed on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. This concerns ‘take it-or-leave-it’ situations where one party supplies a certain contractual term and the micro, small or medium-sized enterprise and start up cannot influence the content of that term despite an attempt to negotiate it. A contractual term that is simply provided by one party and accepted by the micro, small, medium-sized enterprise or a start up or a term that is negotiated and subsequently agreed in an amended way between contracting parties should not be considered as unilaterally imposed.

If a contractual term is not included in the list of terms that are always considered unfair, the general unfairness provision applies. In this regard, the terms listed as unfair terms should serve as a yardstick to interpret the general unfairness provision.

parliament: (60g) Foundation models are a recent development, in which AI models are developed from algorithms designed to optimize for generality and versatility of output. Those models are often trained on a broad range of data sources and large amounts of data to accomplish a wide range of downstream tasks, including some for which they were not specifically developed and trained. The foundation model can be unimodal or multimodal, trained through various methods such as supervised learning or reinforced learning. AI systems with specific intended purpose or general purpose AI systems can be an implementation of a foundation model, which means that each foundation model can be reused in countless downstream AI or general purpose AI systems. These models hold growing importance to many downstream applications and systems.

Recital 60i
commission:

parliament: (60i) In light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI system, it is essential to clarify the role of actors contributing to the development of AI systems. There is significant uncertainty as to the way foundation models will evolve, both in terms of typology of models and in terms of self-governance. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the legal situation of providers of foundation models. Combined with their complexity and unexpected impact, the downstream AI provider’s lack of control over the foundation model’s development and the consequent power imbalance and in order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, such models should be subject to proportionate and more specific requirements and obligations under this Regulation, namely foundation models should assess and mitigate possible risks and harms through appropriate design, testing and analysis, should implement data governance measures, including assessment of biases, and should comply with technical design requirements to ensure appropriate levels of performance, predictability, interpretability, corrigibility, safety and cybersecurity and should comply with environmental standards. These obligations should be accompanied by standards. Also, foundation models should have information obligations and prepare all necessary technical documentation for potential downstream providers to be able to comply with their obligations under this Regulation. Generative foundation models should ensure transparency about the fact the content is generated by an AI system, not by humans. These specific requirements and obligations do not amount to considering foundation models as high risk AI systems, but should guarantee that the objectives of this Regulation to ensure a high level of protection of fundamental rights, health and safety, environment, democracy and rule of law are achieved. Pre-trained models developed for a narrower, less general, more limited set of applications that cannot be adapted for a wide range of tasks such as simple multi-purpose AI systems should not be considered foundation models for the purposes of this Regulation, because of their greater interpretability which makes their behaviour less unpredictable.
draft:

Recital 60j
commission:
council:
parliament: (60j) Given the nature of foundation models, expertise in conformity assessment is lacking and third-party auditing methods are still under development . The sector itself is therefore developing new ways to assess fundamental models that fulfil in part the objective of auditing (such as model evaluation, red-teaming or machine learning verification and validation techniques). Those internal assessments for foundation models should be should be broadly applicable (e.g. independent of distribution channels, modality, development methods), to address risks specific to such models taking into account industry state-of-the art practices and focus on developing sufficient technical understanding and control over the model, the management of reasonably foreseeable risks, and extensive analysis and testing of the model through appropriate measures, such as by the involvement of independent evaluators. As foundation models are a new and fast-evolving development in the field of artificial intelligence, it is appropriate for the Commission and the AI Office to monitor and periodically asses the legislative and governance framework of such models and in particular of generative AI systems based on such models, which raise significant questions related to the generation of content in breach of Union law, copyright rules, and potential misuse. It should be clarified that this Regulation should be without prejudice to Union law on copyright and related rights, including Directives 2001\/29\/EC, 2004\/48\/ECR and (EU) 2019\/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Recital 60c
commission:

parliament:
draft: (60a) The notion of general purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is placed on the market.

Therefore, proportionate transparency measures should be foreseen, including the drawing up and keeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information on the general purpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers. Technical documentation should be prepared and kept up to date by the general purpose AI model provider for the purpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities. The minimal set of elements contained in such documentations should be outlined, respectively, in Annex (XY) and Annex (XX). The Commission should be enabled to amend the Annexes by delegated acts in the light of the evolving technological developments.

General purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be considered free and open-source also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software and data, including models under the condition that the original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected. (60i+1) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including models and general purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and open-source AI components can be provided through different channels, including their development on open repositories. For the purpose of this Regulation, AI components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of technical support or other services, including through a software platform, related to the AI component, or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, with the exception of transactions between micro enterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions provided to free and open source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through open repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

In any case, given that the release of general purpose AI models under free and open source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial information on the dataset used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how thereby the respect of copyright law was ensured, the exception provided for general purpose AI models from compliance with the tranparency related requirements should not concern the obligation to produce a summary about the content used for model training and the obligation to put in place a policy to respect Union copyright law in particular to identify and respect the reservations of rights expressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019\/790.

Without prejudice to Union Copyright law, compliance with these obligations should take due account of the size of the provider and allow simplified ways of compliance for SMEs including start-ups, that should not represent an excessive cost and not discourage the use of such models. In case of a modification or fine tuning of a model, the obligations for providers should be limited to that modification or fine-tuning, for example by complementing the already existing technical documentation with information on the modifications, including new training data sources, as a means to comply with the value chain obligations provided in this Regulation.

draft: (60i) General-purpose models, in particular large generative models, capable of generating text, images, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also challenges to artists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is created, distributed, used and consumed. The development and training of such models require access to vast amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyright protected content requires the authorization of the rightholder concerned unless relevant copyright exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019\/790 introduced exceptions and limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter, for the purposes of text and data mining, under certain conditions. Under these rules, rightholders may choose to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter to prevent text and data mining, unless this is done for the purposes of scientific research. Where the rights to opt out has been expressly reserved in an appropriate manner, providers of general-purpose AI models need to obtain an authorisation from rightholders if they want to carry out text and data mining over such works.

Any provider placing a general purpose AI model on the EU market should comply with this obligation, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts underpinning the training of these general purpose AI models take place.

While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data sources used.

draft: (60m) General-purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited to, any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents, disruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety; any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and economic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. Systemic risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model reach, can arise along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions of misuse, model reliability, model fairness and model security, the degree of autonomy of the model, its access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution strategies, the potential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, international approaches have so far identified the need to devote attention to risks from potential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which barriers to entry can be lowered, including for weapons development, design acquisition, or use; offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, or operational use can be enabled; the effects of interaction and tool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure; risks from models of making copies of themselves or “self-replicating” or training other models; the ways in which models can give rise to harmful bias and discrimination with risks to individuals, communities or societies; the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy with threats to democratic values and human rights; risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain activity or an entire community.

Recital 60n
commission:
council:
parliament:
draft: (60n) It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general purpose AI model as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.

Recital 60o
commission:
council:
parliament:
draft: (60o) It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is especially important with regard to general purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.

A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.

draft: (60q) The providers of general purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone model or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve these objectives, the Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, implementing post market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors across the AI value chain.

draft: (60r) Providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate possible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a general-purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the model causes a serious incident, the general purpose AI model provider should without undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use of or attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unsanctioned releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised access or model theft. This protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and datasets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.

All providers of general-purpose AI models could be invited to participate. To ensure that the Codes of Practice reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of the Codes. Codes of Practice should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of general-purpose models presenting systemic risks. In addition, as regards systemic risks, Codes of Practice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources. Codes of practice should also be focused on specific risk assessment and mitigation measures.

Providers should be able to rely on Codes of Practice to demonstrate compliance with the obligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide common rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time the Regulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed adequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is published and assessed as suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, the compliance with a European harmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of general-purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonized standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those.

draft: (60u) This Regulation regulates AI systems and models by imposing certain requirements and obligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into service or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject to the risk management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065. Consequently, the corresponding obligations of the AI Act should be presumed to be fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022\/2065 emerge and are identified in such models. Within this framework, providers of very large online platforms and very large search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as systemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take appropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights.

For example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches of, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the updated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information.

The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant specific New Legislative Framework legislation. This approach is fully reflected in the interplay between this Regulation and the [Machinery Regulation]. While safety risks of AI systems ensuring safety functions in machinery are addressed by the requirements of this Regulation, certain specific requirements in the [Machinery Regulation] will ensure the safe integration of the AI system into the overall machinery, so as not to compromise the safety of the machinery as a whole. The [Machinery Regulation] applies the same definition of AI system as this Regulation. With regard to high risk AI systems related to products covered by Regulations 745\/2017 and 746\/2017 on medical devices, the applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should be without prejudice and take into account the risk management logic and benefit-risk assessment performed under the medical device framework.

draft: (70a) A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.

In those cases, the transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and use, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate to envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content.

This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation 2022\/2065 for providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to Article 16(1) and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific content.

With the exception of the mandatory sandbox at national level, Member States should also be able to establish virtual or hybrid sandboxes. All regulatory sandboxes should be able to accommodate both physical and virtual products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the regulatory sandboxes have the adequate financial and human resources for their functioning.
draft: (71) Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires fregulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that romotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to disruption, ember States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one artificial intelligence regulatory sandboxes at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. Member States could also fulfill this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or several Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States. Regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources.

commission: (72) The objectives of the regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation; to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the use of personal data collected for other purposes for developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, in line with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679, and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2018\/1725, and without prejudice to Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680. Participants in the sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent authorities, including by following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good faith to mitigate any high-risks to safety and fundamental rights that may arise during the development and experimentation in the sandbox. The conduct of the participants in the sandbox should be taken into account when competent authorities decide whether to impose an administrative fine under Article 83(2) of Regulation 2016\/679 and Article 57 of Directive 2016\/680.

However, in such cases and taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by the Regulation for providers or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, among others, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement in cases where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law.

Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real world testing plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU-wide database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups as well as a written agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the EU data protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only be transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Data Act.

To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at those operators, including on AI literacy, awareness raising and information communication. Member States shall utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish new dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, start-ups, user and other innovators to provide guidance and respond to queries about the implementation of this Regulation. Such existing channels could include but are not limited to ENISA’s Computer Security Incident Response Teams, National Data Protection Agencies, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and other relevant instruments funded by EU programmes as well as the Testing and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member States at national or Union level. Where appropriate, these channels shall work together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to start-ups, SMEs and users. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of small-scale providers shall be taken into account when Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. The Commission shall regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs and start-ups, including through transparent consultations with SMEs, start-ups and users and shall work with Member States to lower such costs. For example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other operators, notably those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-border users.

For the purpose of this Regulation, national supervisory authorities should act as market surveillance authorities for AI systems covered by this Regulation except for AI systems covered by Annex II of this Regulation. For AI systems covered by legal acts listed in the Annex II, the competent authorites under those legal acts should remain the lead authority. National supervisory authorities and competent authorities in the legal acts listed in Annex II should work together whenever necessary. When appropriate, the competent authorities in the legal acts listed in Annex II should send competent staff to the national supervisory authority in order to assist in the performance of its tasks. For the purpose of this Regulation, national supervisory authorities should have the same powers and obligations as market surveillance authorities under Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020. Where necessary for their mandate, national public authorities or bodies, which supervise the application of Union law protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies, should also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. After having exhausted all other reasonable ways to assess\/verify the conformity and upon a reasoned request, the national supervisory authority should be granted access to the training, validation and testing datasets, the trained and training model of the high-risk AI system, including its relevant model parameters and their execution \/run environment. In cases of simpler software systems falling under this Regulation that are not based on trained models, and where all other ways to verify conformity have been exhausted, the national supervisory authority may exceptionally have access to the source code, upon a reasoned request. Where the national supervisory authority has been granted access to the training, validation and testing datasets in accordance with this Regulation, such access should be achieved through appropriate technical means and tools, including on site access and in exceptional circumstances, remote access. The national supervisory authority should treat any information, including source code, software, and data as applicable, obtained as confidential information and respect relevant Union law on the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets. The national supervisory authority should delete any information obtained upon the completion of the investigation.

(80-x) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III insofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III should have effective investigative and corrective powers, including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance authorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence. Any limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016\/680. No exclusion on disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should affect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation. (80x) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be able to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market surveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States. Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the 2019\/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations. (80y) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level as regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping competences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model and system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 for this purpose. In all other cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI systems. However, for general purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high risk, market surveillance authorities should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general purpose AI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding mutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 should apply by analogy. (80z) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the powers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards general purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI systems. (80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general purpose AI models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the information necessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from a provider. (80z+2) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by requesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures, including risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting the making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in case needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of general-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation. _________ 1.

parliament: (80a) Given the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights of natural persons, to ensure the protection of the rule of law and democracy, and taking into account that the mitigation of the risks of AI system against such rights may not be sufficiently achieved at national level or may be subject to diverging interpretation which could ultimately lead to an uneven level of protection of natural persons and create market fragmentation, the national supervisory authorities should be empowered to conduct joint investigations or rely on the union safeguard procedure provided for in this Regulation for effective enforcement. Joint investigations should be initiated where the national supervisory authority have sufficient reasons to believe that an infringement of this Regulation amount to a widespread infringement or a widespread infringement with a Union dimension, or where the AI system or foundation model presents a risk which affects or is likely to affect at least 45 million individuals in more than one Member State.

To ensure that the voluntary codes of conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and key performance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. They should be also developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the involvement of relevant stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia and research organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation. The Commission may develop initiatives, including of a sectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical barriers hindering cross border exchange of data for AI development, including on data access infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of data.
