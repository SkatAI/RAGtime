LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

1.FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE

1.1.Title of the proposal/initiative

Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and Amending Certain Union Legislative Acts

1.2.Policy area(s) concerned

Communications Networks, Content and Technology;

Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs;

The budgetary impact concerns the new tasks entrusted with the Commission, including the support to the EU AI Board;

Activity: Shaping Europe's digital future.

1.3.The proposal/initiative relates to:

X a new action

- a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action 64

- the extension of an existing action

- an action redirected towards a new action

1.4.Objective(s)

1.4.1.General objective(s)

The general objective of the intervention is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market by creating the conditions for the development and use of trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Union.

1.4.2.Specific objective(s)

Specific objective No 1

To set requirements specific to AI systems and obligations on all value chain participants in order to ensure that AI systems placed on the market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values;

Specific objective No 2

To ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI by making it clear what essential requirements, obligations, as well as conformity and compliance procedures must be followed to place or use an AI system in the Union market;

Specific objective No 3

To enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems by providing new powers, resources and clear rules for relevant authorities on conformity assessment and ex post monitoring procedures and the division of governance and supervision tasks between national and EU levels;

Specific objective No 4

To facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation by taking EU action to set minimum requirement for AI systems to be placed and used in the Union market in compliance with existing law on fundamental rights and safety.

1.4.3.Expected result(s) and impact

Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

AI suppliers should benefit from a minimal but clear set of requirements, creating legal certainty and ensuring access to the entire single market.

AI users should benefit from legal certainty that the high-risk AI systems they buy comply with European laws and values.

Consumers should benefit by reducing the risk of violations of their safety or fundamental rights.

1.4.4.Indicators of performance

Specify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative.

Indicator 1

Number of serious incidents or AI performances which constitute a serious incident or a breach of fundamental rights obligations (semi-annual) by fields of applications and calculated a) in absolute terms, b) as share of applications deployed and c) as share of citizens concerned.

Indicator 2

a) Total AI investment in the EU (annual)

b) Total AI investment by Member State (annual)

c) Share of companies using AI (annual)

d) Share of SMEs using AI (annual)

a) and b) will be calculated based on official sources and benchmarked against private estimates

c) and d) will be collected by regular company surveys

1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative

1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

The Regulation should be fully applicable one year and a half after its adoption. However, elements of the governance structure should be in place before then. In particular, Member States shall have appointed existing authorities and/or established new authorities performing the tasks set out in the legislation earlier, and the EU AI Board should be set-up and effective. By the time of applicability, the European database of AI systems should be fully operative. In parallel to the adoption process, it is therefore necessary to develop the database, so that its development has come to an end when the regulation enters into force.

1.5.2.Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

An emerging patchy framework of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the seamless provision of AI systems across the EU and is ineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values across the different Member States. A common EU legislative action on AI could boost the internal market and has great potential to provide European industry with a competitive edge at the global scene and economies of scale that cannot be achieved by individual Member States alone.

1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

The E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides the core framework for the functioning of the single market and the supervision of digital services and sets a basic structure for a general cooperation mechanism among Member States, covering in principle all requirements applicable to digital services. The evaluation of the Directive pointed to shortcomings in several aspects of this cooperation mechanism, including important procedural aspects such as the lack of clear timeframes for response from Member States coupled with a general lack of responsiveness to requests from their counterparts. This has led over the years to a lack of trust between Member States in addressing concerns about providers offering digital services cross-border. The evaluation of the Directive showed the need to define a differentiated set of rules and requirements at European level. For this reason, the implementation of the specific obligations laid down in this Regulation would require a specific cooperation mechanism at EU level, with a governance structure ensuring coordination of specific responsible bodies at EU level.

1.5.4.Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments

The Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence and Amending Certain Union Legislative Acts defines a new common framework of requirements applicable to AI systems, which goes well beyond the framework provided by existing legislation. For this reason, a new national and European regulatory and coordination function needs to be established with this proposal.

As regards possible synergies with other appropriate instruments, the role of notifying authorities at national level can be performed by national authorities fulfilling similar functions sunder other EU regulations.

Moreover, by increasing trust in AI and thus encouraging investment in development and adoption of AI, it complements Digital Europe, for which promoting the diffusion of AI is one of five priorities.

1.5.5.Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment

The staff will be redeployed. The other costs will be supported from the DEP. envelope, given that the objective of this regulation – ensuring trustworthy AI – contributes directly to one key objective of Digital Europe – accelerating AI development and deployment in Europe.

Comments

2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES

2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules

Specify frequency and conditions.

The Regulation will be reviewed and evaluated five years from the entry into force of the regulation. The Commission will report on the findings of the evaluation to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.

2.2.Management and control system(s)

2.2.1.Justification of the management mode(s) , the funding implementation mechanism(s) , the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed

The Regulation establishes a new policy with regard to harmonised rules for the provision of artificial intelligence systems in the internal market while ensuring the respect of safety and fundamental rights. These new rules require a consistency mechanism for the cross-border application of the obligations under this Regulation in the form of a new advisory group coordinating the activities of national authorities.

In order to face these new tasks, it is necessary to appropriately resource the Commission's services. The enforcement of the new Regulation is estimated to require 10 FTE à regime (5 FTE for the support to the activities of the Board and 5 FTE for the European Data Protection Supervisor acting as a notifying body for AI systems deployed by a body of the European Union).

2.2.2.Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them

In order to ensure that the members of the Board have the possibility to make informed analysis on the basis of factual evidence, it is foreseen that the Board should be supported by the administrative structure of the Commission and that an expert group be created to provide additional expertise where required.

2.2.3.Estimate and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio of "control costs ÷ value of the related funds managed") , and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)

For the meeting expenditure, given the low value per transaction (e.g. refunding travel costs for a delegate for a meeting) , standard control procedures seem sufficient. Regarding the development of the database, contract attribution has a strong internal control system in place in DG CNECT through centralised procurement activities.

2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities

Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.

The existing fraud prevention measures applicable to the Commission will cover the additional appropriations necessary for this Regulation.

XX is the policy area or budget title concerned.

The human resources required will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints.

EDPS is expected to provide half of the resources required.

Description of tasks to be carried out:

Officials and temporary staff


To prepare a total of 13-16 meetings, draft reports, continue policy work, e.g. regarding future amendments of the list of high-risk AI applications, and maintain relations with Member States' authorities will require four AD FTE and 1 AST FTE.

For AI systems developed by the EU institutions, the European Data Protection Supervisor is responsible. Based on past experience, it can be estimated that 5 AD FTE are reuqired to fulfill the EDPS responsibilites under the draft legislation.
