Moreover, it should be based on key characteristics of artificial intelligence systems, that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and\/or algorithms from inputs\/data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives; and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond basic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling. The term “machine-based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded).",

Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i.e. military, defence or national security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e.g. civilian purposes, law enforcement, etc.), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.",

        "text":"(14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.",

Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including missing people; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Annex IIa if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, the list of criminal offences as referred in Annex IIa is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002\/584\/JHA9, taking into account that some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat to life or physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Directive 2008\/114\/EC, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State. In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person that is concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify a person who, during an identity check, either refuses to be identified or is unable to state or prove his or her identity, without being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.",

Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017\/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017\/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006\/42\/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any.",

        "text":"(32a) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred to pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in Annex III should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016\/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018\/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases of AI systems.",

The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C\/2022\/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.",

Services important for individuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in case of the materialisation of these risks. The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high-risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use.

These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own.

This Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system.

Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.",

A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is especially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.",

Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate.

Such guarantees should include, among others, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement in cases where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU-wide database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups as well as a written agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the EU data protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only be transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Data Act.",

In order to address the specific needs of SMEs including start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas covered by this Regulation upon request of the AI Board. Additionally, the Commission should complement Member States’ efforts by providing a single information platform with easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems. Medium-sized enterprises which recently changed from the small to medium-size category within the meaning of the Annex to Recommendation 2003\/361\/EC (Article 16) should have access to these support measures, as these new medium-sized enterprises may sometimes lack the legal resources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding and compliance with provisions.",
