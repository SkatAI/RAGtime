    "question": "What are the estimated costs for businesses or public authorities to comply with the requirements for high-risk AI systems by 2025?",
    "answer": {
        "short": "The estimated costs for businesses or public authorities to comply with the requirements for high-risk AI systems by 2025 range from EUR \u20ac 6000 to EUR \u20ac 7000 for the supply of the system and annual costs for human oversight.",
        "expert": "According to the Artificial Intelligence Act, compliance with the requirements for high-risk AI systems by 2025 would imply costs of approximately EUR \u20ac 6000 to EUR \u20ac 7000 for the supply of the system, with additional annual costs of EUR \u20ac 5000 to EUR \u20ac 8000 for ensuring human oversight. Verification costs for suppliers of high-risk AI could amount to another EUR \u20ac 3000 to EUR \u20ac 7500."

        "Compliance with these requirements would imply costs amounting to approximately EUR \u20ac 6000 to EUR \u20ac 7000 for the supply of an average high-risk AI system of around EUR \u20ac 170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the annual cost for the time spent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate, depending on the use case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR \u20ac 5000 to EUR \u20ac 8000 per year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR \u20ac 3000 to EUR \u20ac 7500 for suppliers of high-risk AI."

        "3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS >> 3.3. Impact assessment\nBusinesses or public authorities that develop or use AI applications that constitute a high risk for the safety or fundamental rights of citizens would have to comply with specific requirements and obligations. Compliance with these requirements would imply costs amounting to approximately EUR \u20ac 6000 to EUR \u20ac 7000 for the supply of an average high-risk AI system of around EUR \u20ac 170000 by 2025. For AI users, there would also be the annual cost for the time spent on ensuring human oversight where this is appropriate, depending on the use case. Those have been estimated at approximately EUR \u20ac 5000 to EUR \u20ac 8000 per year. Verification costs could amount to another EUR \u20ac 3000 to EUR \u20ac 7500 for suppliers of high-risk AI. Businesses or public authorities that develop or use any AI applications not classified as high risk would only have minimal obligations of information. However, they could choose to join others and together adopt a code of conduct to follow suitable requirements, and to ensure that their AI systems are trustworthy. In such a case, costs would be at most as high as for high-risk AI systems, but most probably lower.\nThe impacts of the policy options on different categories of stakeholders (economic operators/ business; conformity assessment bodies, standardisation bodies and other public bodies; individuals/citizens; researchers) are explained in detail in Annex 3 of the Impact assessment supporting this proposal.\nAuthor: European Commission, 2021-04-21"
